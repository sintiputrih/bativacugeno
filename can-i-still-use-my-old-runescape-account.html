A Classic player would log in and find themself having to start RS3 (or OSRS) from tutorial. The account itself is not impossible to recover. It might be difficult to recover if the player doesn’t have enough information.</p><h2>Can you use the same account for old and new RuneScape?</h2><p>To RuneScape, or Old School RuneScape, that is the question. A single RuneScape account gets you access to two versions of the game, each with their own separate character profiles.</p><h2>Can I use my old RuneScape account on steam?</h2><p>As soon as you link an account to Steam, both the RuneScape and Old School RuneScape profiles of that account will be linked to the respective games. You can change which account is linked to Steam.</p><h2>Do I need a new email for every RuneScape account?</h2><p>This means you can create multiple RuneScape accounts with a slight variation in the login email and still have all RuneScape emails sent to the one email account. Please note your registered email will be unaltered. Using a unique login email adds an extra layer of security.</p><h2>Beginners Guide to Botting OSRS</h2><h2>Do inactive RuneScape accounts get deleted?</h2><p>No, old inactive accounts don’t ever get deleted. Depending on the account’s stats and/or wealth, the account could be reset after a certain amount of inactivity.</p><h2>How do I recover my old RuneScape account without email?</h2>If you don’t have access to your email, please follow these steps:<li>Create a recovery request using the correct login name or email for the account.</li><li>Choose ‘contact Jagex support’ when prompted.</li><li>Submit a recovery request.</li><h2>How do I recover my RuneScape account?</h2>To recover your account:<li>Head to Account Recovery.</li><li>Enter your username or login email and press “Recover”. …</li><li>Follow the prompts and click “Contact Jagex Support” to fill out the Account Recovery form. …</li><li>Once you’ve regained access to your RuneScape character, upgrade to a Jagex account to keep it secure.</li><h2>Can I play OSRS and RS3 with the same account?</h2><p>Can I play the same character in both RuneScape and Old School simultaneously? No. You can choose to play with your character on either RuneScape or Old School.</p><h2>Can you get banned for account sharing RuneScape?</h2><p>Account Sharing is when multiple people share a single RuneScape account. This directly violates the ‘Buying or selling an account’ rule under Honour, and the punishment for all parties involved in sharing accounts is generally a permanent ban.</p><h2>Is OSRS or RS3 better?</h2><p>Leveling and skilling are much faster in RuneScape 3 which makes it a more casual-friendly title. Old School Runescape requires much more time and patience to play and achieve satisfying results.</p><h2>Can you make a new RuneScape account with the same email as a deleted account?</h2><p>Yes, you can delete an account and then re-use the email to create a brand new account. But, the login is linked to both an RS3 game and an OSRS game. Deleting the login would delete BOTH linked games.</p><h2>Is it too late to get into RuneScape?</h2><p>You Are Never Too Far Behind</p><p>You may have not played the game for a decade and you will still be able to level up quickly and be ready to take on some of the most challenging bosses in the game after a week or two of playing.</p><h2>What happens if I cancel my RuneScape subscription?</h2><p>After cancelling, your membership will be active until your current subscription expires. You won’t be billed for a subscription on that account again (unless you resubscribe) More details are available in our Subscription Terms & Conditions.</p><h2>What if I bought membership for wrong account RuneScape?</h2><p>If you’ve mistakenly bought membership or other items on an account, we can look into transferring the entire transaction to the correct account. To transfer a purchase: Purchases must have been made within the last six months. Purchases must be unused.</p><h2>How many RuneScape accounts can you have?</h2><p>You are free to create as many accounts as you like, and you are welcome to trade between your accounts just as you would with any other player – you can log into two accounts at the same time to do this if you wish.</p><h2>Can I use my old RuneScape account on RS3?</h2><p>Old School Runescape accounts are completely separate from RS3 accounts, no matter which RSPS server you’re using. Each player had to start over from scratch in OSRS when it was created. You can still use the same login details, but there is no in-game connection between the two versions of the game.</p><h2>Does old school runescape carry over?</h2><p>If you have an account on Runescape, it is the same account in OSRS. They are linked – though your progress is not shared between games. Membership also carries over.</p><h2>Does RS3 or OSRS have more players?</h2><p>I just did a quick check and majority of RS3 worlds as of right now have between 30-200 players. Few of them have 300. two of them have 800-900 and a single one has 1500. Old school, about 80% of the worlds have between 400-1000 players.</p><h2>How do I find out how old my OSRS account is?</h2><p>To check your account age, you need to go to the Castle in Lumbridge and look for Hans, who is walking around the courtyard. Right-click on him and choose the “Can you tell me how long I’ve been here?” dialogue option.</p><h2>Why do RuneScape accounts get locked?</h2><p>You either forgot your account name/password, you’re misspelling either one (or both), or someone hacked you and changed your password. If you’re 100% sure you’re logging in with the correct details, then it’s probably the latter.</p><h2>Why does Jagex lock accounts?</h2><p>If you’ve upgraded to a Jagex account, please head to our Account recovery article on the Jagex Support Centre. For your protection, your account may be locked if suspicious activity has been recently detected. In this situation, your account will remain locked until it is successfully recovered by the owner.</p><h2>Why can’t I log into my RuneScape account?</h2><p>You must use the ‘Reset’ password button under “If you don’t have access to your account”. If the reset password link still gives an error message and doesn’t work, try clearing your browser cache. Having to remove an Auth you didn’t set is a sure sign that someone else has access to your account.</p><h2>How do I recover an old email account?</h2><p>Most email service providers offer account recovery options such as resetting passwords or answering security questions. Look for these options on the sign-in page of your email service provider’s website and follow the prompts provided.</p><h2>How long does it take to recover OSRS account?</h2><p>Recovery replies can take up to 24 hours. If you have waited 24 hours and not received any reply at all, submit another recovery form and use a different contact email. I recommend you use a Gmail email as they are the least troublesome with Jagex replies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWgmrGqrY6cmKdlmWLAtbXLpWSuq5Viurp5zqWbZqqlo7K0r8CpnGaZk5i8trrTaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcan-i-still-use-my-old-runescape-account.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcan-i-still-use-my-old-runescape-account.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcan-i-still-use-my-old-runescape-account.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcan-i-still-use-my-old-runescape-account.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcan-i-still-use-my-old-runescape-account.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcan-i-still-use-my-old-runescape-account.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jazmine-sullivan-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jazmine-sullivan-net-worth-2024.html>Jazmine Sullivan Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-to-complete-ukouh-shrine-tears-of-the-kingdom.html>Ukouh Shrine Guide Using Ultrahand in 'Tears of the Kingdom'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-to-complete-ukouh-shrine-tears-of-the-kingdom.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
