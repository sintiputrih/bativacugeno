The Taliban is back in power, and women in the past 20 years have seen a very different life — they were able to enroll in schools and take jobs.

Receiving my degree from Oxford is a dream come true. I stood up for education at age 11, when the Taliban was banning girls from going to school. I remember that day vividly when I could not go to school; I wanted to be in a classroom. Looking at my graduation pictures is a reminder that this might not have been possible if the Taliban had remained in [Pakistan's] Swat Valley, if people had not heard our voices.

Historically, it has not favored women. Even now, in communities around the world, it does not favor women. But if you find a best friend in life and that person loves you and understands your concerns, you can start a journey together and help each other through. Marriage is a social construct, so if we created it, we can change it.

In 2020, she successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court to preserve access to abortion in Louisiana, but the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the subsequent appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett left the fate of Roe v.

Jackson Women's Health Organization, concerning a Mississippi abortion ban after 15 weeks that, if upheld, would effectively overturn Roe v. Wade. "It's critical for people to be able to make these kinds of personal decisions about their bodies, lives, and health for themselves," says Rikelman. "As a mom, I know pregnancy has unique demands and life-altering consequences for families.

Even with four gold medals under her belt, Masters's journey has been far from golden. Both of her legs were damaged in utero by radiation poisoning from the Chernobyl nuclear reactor incident, and after being adopted from a Ukrainian orphanage at a young age, Masters had to fight to earn her spot on the team.

With two books published in November and a 1619 docuseries in the works at Hulu, Hannah-Jones sees abundant opportunities for 1619 to take different shapes as an ongoing educational project. "People are hungry for this information; they want to have a better understanding of their country and its most vexing problems," she says.

She resisted the officer during her arrest, defying a rule she knew was unjust. Though her courageous act came nine months before Rosa Parks would be elevated as a leader in the Civil Rights Movement for doing the same thing, Colvin was not championed by prominent Black organizers at the time; they instead decided to rally behind Parks, who was considered a more palatable figure than Colvin. "The leaders chose Mrs. Parks because she had been through nonviolence training and would be more acceptable," says Colvin. "I didn't hold any animosity because they did what was best for the movement. It was not about one person; it was about moving our people forward." Colvin's brave deed resulted in her obtaining a criminal record, and over half a century later, the charge of assaulting an officer during her arrest remained. She was placed on probation and never received notice that her term was complete. In October 2021 her attorney filed an expungement request, signifying that the charges against her were never right. "Clearing my name doesn't mean anything to me now and doesn't benefit me at all," says Colvin. "But it does let my grandchildren and great-grandchildren know that I didn't do anything wrong. All I did was sit down for my rights so that they could stand up for theirs."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Having amassed a wealth of knowledge on advocacy from her own experiences, she encourages today's activists to remember that when it comes to seeking justice, there is no easy way to achieve large-scale progress. "You can't sugarcoat it," says Colvin. "You have to take a stand and say, 'This is not right.' " And if she could share a few words of wisdom with her younger self? "I would like to tell my 15-year-old self that it wasn't fair what happened, and you didn't know it then, but your decisions would change the world."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-17-raeshem-nijhon></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_93-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>17.

There are people who were directly in harm's way because they were our allies. In that complete collapse, thousands of Americans — accountants, college professors, journalists — were flooded with WhatsApp messages from people we know who needed help. We began to do everything we could to organize private evacuations; nobody knew anything about how to run them, but my friend and colleague Dexter Filkins and I joined Ashley Bommer Singh and Vikram Singh, a husband-and-wife team that was organizing private evacuations through a plane-charter company.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_125-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>JK:</strong> Where did you get the money?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_127-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>EG:</strong> Everywhere and through myriad connections. I reached out to folks in the media, some I knew personally and some through mutual friends, and I told them we were raising money to fund evacuations. Within 10 minutes the women of Hollywood were in my email offering tens of thousands of dollars for these flights, and within days we had what we needed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_129-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>JK:</strong> So, it's summer, you've got an 8-year-old, you're sitting with your laptop and your phone, and you've got this river of panic, urgency, and life-and-death decision-making, not to mention money, flowing through your electronic devices.

We were never alone; there were so many heroic people in special operations and intelligence who stepped up and helped us. Through WhatsApp, we were connected with an amazing Afghan here in America who translated directions to meeting locations. You see family by family appearing in a chat where we're outlining it all. Then I'm coordinating with the special operations guy who's running the airport, and he needs to get permission, and he knows our buses are coming. So there's the military contractor we're paying for the buses, and he's coordinating with those drivers. And then suddenly some unknown person drops into the chat and informs us it's a go, we may move forward.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_133-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>JK:</strong> And where are you sitting when this is happening?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_135-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>EG:</strong> Literally in a pair of running shorts on my back porch. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of us all working on this through our phones and laptops. I don't have a physical experience of being in my body during that time — there was no sleep. I didn't know it was possible to not sleep for two weeks at a time. My sister completely stepped in and got my little one to camp and back. It's had long-reaching effects for him — he's pretty angry about it and confused — but it's just a tiny thing when you consider that the Afghan family I was working most closely with didn't sleep for six months.

Her UCLA class on Black horror aesthetics is so essential that big names, including Peele, have been known to drop in.

Two years later she would become the first African American to win the Scripps National Spelling Bee. "People say that I am a genius or something—and no, I am just a normal 15-year-old girl," she says. "You can do this; there's no special juice or something I have drunk." Since she was 5 years old, the main outlet for the polymath's competitive spirit has been basketball. She's a standout on the court and holds multiple Guinness World Records for her ball-handling skills. "I love the camaraderie and the competition," she says. A slew of celebrities and public figures have been in touch with her since taking home the Scripps title, including her personal hero, Malala Yousafzai, whose autobiography Avant-garde credits as a huge inspiration. With the spotlight has also come some criticism — she notes her natural hair as something haters like to pick at — but, seasoned competitor that she is, Avant-garde is virtually unflappable. "You wouldn't believe how many times I've been disparaged," she says. "Not letting anybody push me down because of something that I am, or letting anybody stand in my way, is my most badass quality." Driven by a zeal for education fostered through homeschooling, Avant-garde is in constant pursuit of her next lesson. "I'm learning Spanish, learning to play the piano, and learning to be a bit less shy; I feel like I need to work on being myself more," she says. "That's what I'm looking forward to in the near future."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_205-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Shizuo Kambayashi/AFP/Getty; courtesy HBO; Paul Grandsard; Adria Malcolm; courtesy Domino Kirke-Badgley</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-36-mako-komuro></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_206-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>36.

Ozoma's determination to change the industry also led her to cosponsor California's Silenced No More Act, which took effect January 1.
