Aside from Ed Harris, Aaron Paul, Thandiwe Newton, and Jeffrey Wright, we don't even know which cast members will return. Of course, given the premise of the show, even those who have been killed off or moved to another realm, such as Evan Rachel Wood's Dolores and James Marsden's Teddy, can return.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, James Marsden has been on the show since the second season and Evan Rachel Wood's<a href=#> life has been changed since her scandal</a> with Marilyn Manson. So, we may or may not see them return to the show when it comes back this year. And this seems to be much to their chagrin as Evan and James appear to have had an incredibly close relationship while filming the series.</p><h2 id=do-evan-rachel-wood-and-james-marsden-actually-like-each-other>Do Evan Rachel Wood And James Marsden Actually Like Each Other?</h2><p>It absolutely appears as though Evan and James are very close. But before you start the rumors, <a href=#>James is happy in a relationship with Emma Deigman </a>and the two are just good friends. Of course, this turned out to be quite important to how the two processed what went down between their characters in the second season of Westworld. On-screen their relationship was crumbling in heartbreaking and violent ways, but off-screen they had each other's backs.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is Evan Rachel Wood Making For 'Westworld'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Evan and I have a great relationship, we have a lot of fun on set. We cherish these characters and their dynamic and their connection. So it was a sad day when all of that went down. But we also know that we’re telling a long story, and we’ll see where it all goes," James Marsden explained during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2018 interview with Vulture</a>.</p><p>Given Westworld's incredibly dark and foreboding tone, James was thrilled that Evan liked to break character and have fun between takes. Unlike some actors, such as <a href=#>Daniel Day-Lewis who has been known to take things too fa</a>r, neither Evan nor James are method. This meant they could have a laugh without harming one another's creativity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>James Marsden's Character In Netflix's 'Dead To Me' Made Christina Applegate's Skin Crawl</a></span></p><p>"Thank god Evan’s got a remarkably sharp sense of humor and everyone on the show likes to have a good time. But I’ve never seen someone with the ability to really flip a switch, and when they yell action Evan transforms without a single movement. It’s all behind her eyes. She just shows you into the darkest corners of her mind with a look. Then they yell 'cut' and she starts laughing. It’s great. We have a lot of fun on set pretending the show is a musical, pretending it was a spinoff of a Ron Burgundy movie — it gets very, very silly on set," James explained to Vulture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-it-awkward-for-james-marsden-to-shoot-intimate-scenes-with-evan-rachel-wood>Is It Awkward For James Marsden To Shoot Intimate Scenes With Evan Rachel Wood?</h2><p>Some actors who become close friends on set have a hard time becoming physical with each other during the intimate scenes they are required to shoot. And in the second season, there are quite a few NSFW moments between Evan and James' characters. But James told Vulture that he and Evan never had a hard time with the sex scenes because they are so used to them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between James Marsden And His Ex Wife, Lisa Linde?</a></span></p><p>"When we do our love scene, Evan and I go, 'Okay, well we’ve seen each other’s everything already, from every given angle so here we go again.' We’re sort of like eh, no big deal now. Obviously, we kind of show up and go, 'Oh, what kind of crazy bulls** do we get to do today?' Like oh, we have to take off all our clothes and lay with, you know, blood seeping out of our bodies, and oh, take off all our clothes again and get in bed together. Okay, now we get to go into a rotted meat locker and betray each other. Obviously, she takes it very seriously and so do I, but in between in those big gaps of time when they’re setting up the cameras and moving locations, we try to keep it as light as possible."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's clear that Evan and James keep their relationship off-set light and fun as well. Even though the two don't appear to spend a lot of social time together, they did an epic Carpool Karaoke together that proves their chill connection is entirely authentic. On top of this, the pair were spotted doing actually karaoke together in 2014 in New Orleans. While they may or may not return to the screen together in the fourth season of Westworld, they seem to have developed a true friendship.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans Send Outpouring Love To Evan Rachel Wood After Statement Regarding Marilyn Manson's Abuse</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqWVqHqurdGsm56mXZa7pXnEr5inZaKWsKmxy2auqKeUqHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMn5icrKNk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjames-marsden-and-evan-rachel-woods-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjames-marsden-and-evan-rachel-woods-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjames-marsden-and-evan-rachel-woods-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjames-marsden-and-evan-rachel-woods-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjames-marsden-and-evan-rachel-woods-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjames-marsden-and-evan-rachel-woods-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./209812-bewitched-star-agnes-moorehead-life-deat-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./209812-bewitched-star-agnes-moorehead-life-deat-html.html>'Bewitched' Star Agnes Moorehead Life and Death of the Beloved Actress</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./scott-brown-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html>Scott Brown Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./scott-brown-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
