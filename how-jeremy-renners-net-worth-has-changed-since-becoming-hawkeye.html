<time>01 Jan 0001, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Jeremy Renner is a huge name in the action genre of film. Renner was cast to play the superhero Hawkeye in the <strong><a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></strong> back in 2011 for the first Thor film. Since then, Renner has starred in numerous Avengers films as well as having his own television show on Disney + with Hailee Steinfeld. His role in the Marvel franchise also opened the door for him to star in films like Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The money Renner has earned through Marvel has completely changed his life. The actor is now able to follow his passions, which includes making music and flipping houses. He is also able to create small films because he is no longer reliant on a paycheck. Here’s how Jeremy Renner’s net worth has changed since becoming Hawkeye.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Was Jeremy Renner’s Life Before Becoming Hawkeye</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-jeremy-renner><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is Jeremy Renner?</span></h2><p>Jeremy Renner is an actor best known for his role as Hawkeye in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He first began acting in 1995, but he did not land his breakout role until 2008 with The Hurt Locker. Renner was nominated for an Oscar award for his performance in the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Renner was in the news at the beginning of 2023 after he was in a snow plowing accident on New Year’s Day. He celebrated his 52nd birthday in the hospital. Renner has shared updates on his health on social media, and the actor has a long road to recovery in front of him.</p><h2 id=jeremy-renner-lived-off-top-ramen><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jeremy Renner Lived Off Top Ramen</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar50881542.jpg><p>Before Jeremy Renner was the well-known actor he is today, Renner was struggling to make ends meet. He had given himself 11 years to accomplish his goals in the entertainment industry, and for a time his life looked rather bleak.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Renner spoke to Men’s Health about his life in the early 2000s. Around the time he starred in the film Dahmer, Renner only had a $10 monthly food budget. He lived off of top ramen and McDonald’s. The actor “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had no electricity, no gas, no hot water</a>,” but he was “glad I’m not doing a job just for a paycheck. That’d be fucking miserable. And most people are.”</p><h2 id=jeremy-renner-prefers-passion-projects-over-paycheck><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jeremy Renner Prefers Passion Projects Over Paycheck</span></h2><p>Despite now having a very impressive net worth, Jeremy Renner has never been one to care about how much he gets paid for a role. He has always been the kind of actor who would choose a passion project over a paycheck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was certainly true in 2017 when he and Elizabeth Olsen filmed Wind River. Due to Renner’s celebrity status and affiliation with Marvel, they were able to create the film and take paycuts for the sake of the movie. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">That movie gets made because Lizzy and I are Avengers</a>, which helps us get the smaller movies made,” Renner told Indie Wire. “That is an important, emotional movie, and hopeful and thoughtful. Big movies allow little ones to get made.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jeremy Renner Turned Down A Major Script That Made $100 Million At The Box Office</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-does-marvel-pay-jeremy-renner><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Much Does Marvel Pay Jeremy Renner?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar50815140.jpg><p>Jeremy Renner has been playing the role of Hawkeye since 2011 when he made a cameo in Thor. Since then, Renner has starred in four Marvel films. He was also a part of their Disney + show What If…? and had his own show called Hawkeye. He is rumored to be in the upcoming Avengers: The Kang Dynasty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His first big paycheck from Marvel for Avengers was reportedly $3 million, but that number skyrocketed to $15 million by the time of Avengers: Endgame. Like Renner, <a href=#>Brie Larson used to worry about money before Marvel</a>, but now both are top paid actors.</p><h2 id=jeremy-renner-rsquo-s-paychecks-not-from-marvel><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jeremy Renner’s Paychecks Not From Marvel</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar50926528.jpg><p>While Marvel has paid Jeremy Renner a great deal of money for playing Hawkeye, the most important thing the role did for Renner was open the door to other films. Since playing Hawkeye, Renner has had roles in the Mission Impossible and Bourne franchises, as well as standalone films such as Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters and American Hustle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though American Hustle only paid Renner $1 million in 2013, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters paid the actor $7 million that same year. <a href=#>Renner’s most profitable role outside of Marvel was </a><a href=#>Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation</a>, which paid him $8 million.</p><h2 id=jeremy-renner-makes-music><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jeremy Renner Makes Music</span></h2><p>Jeremy Renner is more than just an actor. He also has passions for music and flipping houses. To date, Renner has released two EPs. Renner has also recorded music for films, such as his song “Believer” for Arctic Dogs.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Acting came into my brain around 20</a>,” Renner told People in 2019. “Music has always been my first love.” Renner also enjoys remodeling homes and flipping houses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Kevin Bacon Joining The MCU After His Stint In The Guardians Of The Galaxy?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-renner-make-for-hawkeye><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>How Much Money Did Renner Make For Hawkeye?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar50881561.jpg><p>Though he claimed <a href=#>he did not want to continue playing a character in tights</a>, Jeremy Renner starred in the Disney+ show Hawkeye with Hailee Steinfeld. Hawkeye was the first standalone in Marvel that Renner was given, as he previously only appeared in ensemble films.</p><p>Though his salary for the television show is not publicly known, it can be assumed he made at least $15 million. That was the amount Renner was paid for Avengers: Endgame, and that film was an ensemble piece while Hawkeye gave Renner much more screen time as the lead role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-jeremy-renner-rsquo-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Is Jeremy Renner’s Net Worth?</span></h2><p>With all of his work with Marvel and other action franchises, it is no surprise that Jeremy Renner has accumulated a massive net worth. The actor has come a long way since living off of top ramen in the early 2000s.</p><p>Renner’s net worth is reportedly $80 million. If he does appear in Marvel’s Avengers: The Kang Dynasty as he is rumored, his net worth will increase. He is also currently in pre-production of an untitled project and has a new Disney+ show on the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dn7KzscyyZKudnqOys7%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jKGYrGWTna6vs8SdZKyhnpiybq7EnKamoZ6ceqmt1qScsp1f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-jeremy-renners-net-worth-has-changed-since-becoming-hawkeye.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-jeremy-renners-net-worth-has-changed-since-becoming-hawkeye.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-jeremy-renners-net-worth-has-changed-since-becoming-hawkeye.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-jeremy-renners-net-worth-has-changed-since-becoming-hawkeye.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-jeremy-renners-net-worth-has-changed-since-becoming-hawkeye.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-jeremy-renners-net-worth-has-changed-since-becoming-hawkeye.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./inside-kevin-federline-and-his-wife-victoria-prince-relationship-timeline-378555-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./inside-kevin-federline-and-his-wife-victoria-prince-relationship-timeline-378555-html.html>Inside Kevin Federline And His Wife Victoria Prince Relationship Timeline</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./greg-whittington.html>Greg Whittington Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./greg-whittington.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
