Despite becoming most pronounced during the holiday season — the network heavily promotes them, and other male leads, as “hunks of Hallmark” — their work spans genres and equinox, providing a rare type of stability that’s been phased out at Hollywood studios over the years. “As an actor,” Walker says, “I could not have any better-case scenario.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5je001p3b7cfc3f9j30@published data-word-count=141>But these actors’ affinity for the channel goes deeper than the promise of a steady paycheck.

But just like people returning to their small towns for the holidays, that formula is capable of change and nuance, and Hynes, Walker, and Campbell have an insider’s perspective on what’s changed at the network over the years as well as what other evolutions might lie ahead. They also hope to do a spiritual sequel to Three Wise Men and a Baby, with three or four ideas currently in the mix “based on classic trios.” But they’re in no rush.

I had started a juice company with my wife. I was going to take six months off acting and start the business, and about a year and a half later I was underwater. We were trying to figure out how to get our lives back. I had become very resentful toward my business because it had taken me away from my acting. I thought, Oh yeah, I’ll take some time off. I do a lot of work for ABC and whatnot. I’ll get it back in no time. I was wrong. But out of the blue, I got a call from my manager, and he said, “Hey, you got an offer to do a Hallmark movie. They want you to come up to Vancouver and shoot it.” And I was like, “A Hallmark movie? Don’t they make greeting cards?” I read the script and it was cute, so I jumped on an airplane and did my first movie and had a great time. The director was Gary Yates, who —</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5n8002p3b7ckgmzvkwd@published data-word-count=9><strong>Paul Campbell: </strong>Gary is universally beloved, by the way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5jg001q3b7c1jt1rjd8@published data-word-count=13><strong>AW: </strong>We’ve all done movies with him.

I wish I could say it wasn’t because I was broke, but I had gone broke living in L.A. despite a good role in Battlestar Galactica. I got an audition for a Hallmark movie. I never auditioned for one before because my representation unequivocally said from day one, “You’re not going to do Hallmark movies.” So my agent in Vancouver was going to pass on it, but I said, “Let me read it at least, I’m broke, come on.” So I read it and was like, This is one of the most fun scripts I’ve ever read. Why would I not want to do this? That was Winter Wonderland in 2013.&nbsp;After that, I said, “I’ll <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-2 tabindex=0>do as many</span> as the channel throws out.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5jt001u3b7cm28i0pke@published data-word-count=68><strong>TH: </strong>I’ve been doing this for about five years now.

Notting Hill is one of my favorite movies ever. I think Hugh Grant is the most underrated actor of all time. If Hugh Grant and Meg Ryan ended up in a Hallmark movie, I’d be the happiest dude ever. I started to go, “I’m going to make these movies from where I want to make them.” That was yielding a reaction from the people I’m working with and the executives. There’s a large turnaround and a lot of moving parts; you don’t assume somebody would be that thoughtful or specific in their observations on something you’re doing. This is when I started to go, “Okay, this is <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-3 tabindex=0>an interesting place</span> to explore and push the boundaries of what we can handle.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5ks00213b7c3hnpznvj@published data-word-count=186><strong>A lot of people who watch these holiday films describe them with similar verbiage. They’re comforting. They’re set in fantasy worlds. They’re predictable. These sentiments are often expressed by the actors themselves.

There’s a reason why nurses and teachers are the primary viewers for these movies. I don’t think we go into it saying, “I’m going to be a certain type of person that’s unrealistic to the everyday person out there.” There’s the quintessential walk-and-talk, and there’s specific big beats and moments that we have to hit in these movies to make it “a Hallmark movie.” A lot of the actors are bringing in their life stories. They’re bringing in baggage. The perfect example is Three Wise Men and a Baby. Paul and Kimberley Sustad wrote this unbelievable script about real people going through real issues. We saw how much of an impact it made on the viewers.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5os00353b7c8y7ljenb@published data-word-count=36>I wouldn’t be surprised if Hugh Grant or Meg Ryan wanted to get involved one day.

The happy ending is essential. There has to be eternal hope alive. The reason people tune in is because they know how these things end. They tune in because they want to see the kiss. Regardless of circumstance, we’re telling stories about relatable characters. They could be you or me or anybody, and there’s always a message of hope at the end. There’s so much pain and suffering, and there’s so much despair. The escapism is going into this world where everything will ultimately turn out okay, regardless of how it starts.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5mh002i3b7czkg84egz@published data-word-count=92><strong>TH: </strong>It’s so rare in any business, or any corner of entertainment, to make something that people want to consume. We’ve made a formula that works. I think it’s the consistency of the journey you’re going to be on. I watch certain directors who I love and I know for that same consistency. We’ve created a brand around a certain kind of experience of a genre that was being left by the wayside. What’s interesting is that Hallmark has created its sort of own subgenre, which now Hollywood is trying to impersonate.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5kr00203b7c0egph1jd@published data-word-count=85><strong>What is that subgenre?</strong><br><strong>PC: </strong>The genre is feeling. And it’s a feeling you can’t articulate. These movies are deceptively complicated. Everyone goes, “Oh, what simple, cheesy stories.” They’re not. They’re really complex in their simplicity. They’re hard to write, they’re hard to act, and they’re hard to create the feeling over and over again that everyone tunes in for. There have been a lot of actors over the years who come in, do one movie, and don’t come back because they don’t quite get it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5x5003n3b7cwzguuxr0@published data-word-count=45><strong>TH: </strong>Having done the amount of movies all three of us have done, the goal then becomes, how do we maintain that nucleus of a feeling?

Some movies have sat on the shelf for seven or eight years before they’re made, and they’ve gone through so many different hands. It’s the nuance. Hallmark has gone through a lot of different variations of what its “aesthetics” are. There was a period where we couldn’t be in plaid clothing or we couldn’t be eating in a scene.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5l100223b7cs6brmnin@published data-word-count=187><strong>Paul, you’ve transitioned to a dual role <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-4 tabindex=0>as a writer</span> and actor. How do you balance the network’s edict for writing these movies while trying to expand what they’re capable of doing?</strong><br><strong>PC: </strong>In the last three or four years since management has changed at the top, there’s been a slightly new broadening of direction. Three Wise Men and a Baby was a big swing. It was something they’d never done before. The idea of putting three male leads together in a movie was a little scary, because they didn’t know how that would be received. As a writer, there’s no defined formula, but intuitively, we all understand what the thing is. I understand the feeling we’re trying to provoke. More and more, we’re telling stories about people who have more damage and conflict. It’s not as glossy as it once was. Then on the opposite side, the humor comes with the tragedy. The more broken, hurt, or pain someone is feeling, the funnier you can make a script. Comedy only comes from pain, so the more pain there is, there’s more humor. It’s a great balance.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5l300243b7cwih2tv9y@published data-word-count=154>We try things all the time that get edged back. My character in Three Wise Men and a Baby had an anxiety disorder, and we wanted to have him taking his anxiety medication front and center of the camera. We put it in the script and were sure it was going to get walked back, because it feels like it’s a little too hard to watch somebody having to deal in the moment with something that’s a painful struggle. To see him actually take the pills means you have to acknowledge that his disorder is a real thing. If he doesn’t take the pills, you can kind of go, “I don’t know. He’s got some stuff going on.” Hallmark said, “Yeah, absolutely. We’d like to see that. That’s a big part of his journey.” I don’t know if three or four years ago that would’ve made it into the edit, if I’m being honest.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5lv002e3b7cbx78ilg0@published data-word-count=23>That said, there are still some restrictions. I can’t write “sucks.” I can write “jerk,” which is pretty fun and opens some doors.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5l700263b7c651tygak@published data-word-count=17><strong>AW: </strong>My young kids would say “sucks” is a bad word.

I’ll write “rats” or “jeepers.” I wrote a joke about marrying a cat in a recent script. There was a joke where my character went, “Marriage is different for everybody. Love is different. I love my cat, but I wouldn’t marry my cat.” And then another character goes, “Yeah, because of the legal red tape.” Hallmark told me, “We can’t tell a joke about the only reason he’s not marrying his cat is because legally he can’t marry his cat.” They walked that one one back. That was a good joke, though.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5ot00363b7czu8slcfb@published data-word-count=36><strong>What other sort of meaningful narrative progression do you think could be accomplished in the near future?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>TH: </strong>There’s no reason why you can’t represent more versions of love.

I did a movie this year called Christmas Island, and at the end of the movie our characters were like, “We don’t know how this is going to work, but we’ll try to make it work.” She goes off as a pilot, and I have to stay on the island. It wasn’t your typical Hallmark ending to a movie, because there’s still an element of uncertainty in the air.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5la00273b7cemzx63gs@published data-word-count=115><strong>PC: </strong>Though we can’t underestimate the power of the happy ending and the kiss at the end. I think the audience really does tune in for that and it’s part of the message of hope. We’re telling romantic comedies and it needs a satisfying ending. People may disagree. Without the kiss, movies do lose something. You can still have this message of hope, like, “I’ll be okay on my own and single. I’m fine; I’ve found my peace.” But it’s not as satisfying of an ending. You go, “Ah, that was okay, but I really wish …” We all just want to see that kiss, right? I think it’s better when that connection is made.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5mi002j3b7c8wdu5tqf@published data-word-count=25><strong>TH:</strong> Maybe at first you go, like, “Yeah, that’s realistic to life.” And then you leave and think, “Wait, what?

For example, we’re not constantly saving the community center or getting that promotion. The emotional arc of the character is becoming more important. There’s something equally satisfying in just realizing that you’re okay being you at the end. Everything is okay. Just having somebody hold your hand and say, “Hey, it’s okay just being you” is actually a satisfying and more relatable arc for people. I don’t know, people seem to be generally a lot more depressed and down these days. I’m not going to go off on a tangent about social media, but I think it’s killing us. I think it’s slowly poisoning our entire population.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqbid5m1002g3b7c3wp8lpdz@published data-word-count=30><strong>TH: </strong>In my next movie, I play a social-media agent.

So when you heard Candace Cameron Bure declare that Hallmark has become “basically a completely different network” because of leadership changes, and <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-5 tabindex=0>departed</span> because of it, how did you all interpret her comment?</strong><br><strong>AW: </strong>I think it was just a good excuse to cover up an opportunity she had somewhere else.

You get somebody like Lisa Hamilton at the top, who replaced Bill Abbott, who’s now making these choices that are affecting the network. The formula is pretty sound.
