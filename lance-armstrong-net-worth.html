It was remodeled heavily to give some contemporary touches. The Mediterranean-style house sits on close to half-acre of land across the street from Pease Park in the historic Old Enfield neighborhood.</p><p>Even though the house was remodeled, it still has its original style and charm.</p><p>The main house has 8,158 square feet of living space over three-story. House features spacious living areas for families on the first floor, five beds suites on the second level, and seven full and one-half baths.</p><p>The third floor also has a large bedroom with an ensuite bathroom.</p><p>Outside of the house features a huge pool with a fountain, tons of lounging areas, a separate pool house with a kitchenette, and a full bathroom.</p><p>Just like his other house, he listed the property for a whopping $7.5 million in 2018.</p><h4>Aspen House, Colorado</h4><p>Lance purchased this mega-mansion back in 2008 as it was being built and splashed over $9.2.</p><p>The house spans over 5,915 square feet of living space with five bedrooms, five full and five half bathrooms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lance-Armstrong-Aspen-House.jpg><p>It features solid wood doors, a gourmet kitchen, a spacious and comfortable family room, a wine room, a covered patio, and an entertainment room with a pool table.</p><p>Lance listed this house for $14.5 million with a 20% down payment of $2.9 million.&nbsp; The monthly payment would be approximately $48,134 on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage at an interest rate of 2.87 percent.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Unlike his choices of houses, Lance does not seem to be a huge car guy.</p><p>He drives rather decent cars as opposed to shiny ones.</p><h4>Nissan LEAF</h4><p>Nissan LEAF is a compact and stylish five-door hatchback electric vehicle manufactured by Nissan.</p><p>It was introduced in 2010, first in Japan and in the United States, and is currently the second generation which was introduced in October of 2017.</p><p>Thanks to several minor improvements, LEAF’s range on full charge has been increased from 117 km to 364 km during its product life cycle.</p><p>The car was awarded Green Car Vision Award in 2010, European Car of the Year in 2011, and 2011-2012 Car of the Year Japan.</p><p>The price of the car starts from $27,400.</p><p>Nissan LEAF is listed as the world’s all-time top-selling plug-in electric car through December 2019.</p><h4>GMC Yukon</h4><p>GMC Yukon is a full-size SUV that comes with a 5.3-liter V8 engine that generates 355 brake horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque.</p><p>The base price for the SUV is $50,000.</p><p>Back in 2015, Lance was involved in a crash along with his girlfriend, Anna Hansen.</p><p>The SUV allegedly crashed into parked cars, of which his girlfriend Anna Hansen took full blame to keep Armstrong out of national headlines.</p><p>However, it was later revealed that Lance was the one driving the car, and he was a little drunk, which made him lose control of the car and banged on the parked cars.</p><h2>Lifestyle and Vacations</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>After the doping, Lance was banned from all sports; however, he still continues to cycle but not competitively.</p><p>He shares his cycling updates on his social media handle and takes part in non-competitive races worldwide.</p><p>Lance is living a pretty luxurious lifestyle given by his net worth.</p><p>He is an avid art collector. In fact, he’s been collecting the art pieces for almost twenty-plus years.</p><p>Similarly, Lance also loves drinking wine and beer.</p><p>Lance was diagnosed with testicular cancer on October 2, 1996. As a result, he had to go through two operations; One to remove the testis and the other to remove the cancer metastases from the brain.</p><p>He also had to go through intense chemotherapy.</p><p>These days Lance just loves spending his time with his family.</p><h3>Vacations</h3><p>As for vacations, Lance loves going on exotic vacations.</p><p>Back in 2014, Lance was spotted enjoying a Hawaiian vacation with his girlfriend and two children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lance-Armstrong-Vacation.jpg><p>He was seen showing off his curves as he paddled shirtless in the sea.</p><p>Other than this, no information about vacations is available.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>Lance Armstrong has his own foundation, which he established after he recovered from testicular cancer. The foundation was called Lance Armstrong Foundation but later renamed to Livestrong foundation.</p><p>The foundation raised over $500 million for cancer research, treatment, and support. Lance himself donated over $6.5 million personally.</p><p>Apart from that, Lance Armstrong has been involved in 15 charitable organizations and supports 15 causes, including Cancer, Children, Poverty, Sports, Physical Challenges, and many more.</p><p>Similarly, Lance took part and ran in NY Marathon in support of his foundation Lance Armstrong Foundation.</p><p>Likewise, Lance also donated his shoe which he wore during one of his Tour de France wins, to be auctioned off for Leukemia Research.</p><h2>Movies, Endorsements, Investments, and Books</h2><h3>Movie</h3><p>Lance Armstrong has made some screen appearances throughout his career.</p><p>In 2017 he appeared in the TV Movie<strong> Tour de Pharmacy</strong>; similarly, in 2004, he appeared in <strong>Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story</strong>.</p><p>Likewise, Lance also appeared in 2006 <strong>You, Me and Dupree</strong> and 2008 <strong>The Simpsons</strong>.</p><h3>Endorsements</h3><p>During the peak of his career, Lance endorsed some of the top brands in the world, including Nike, Honey Stinger, Trek, Easton-Bell Sports, Motorola, and 24-hour fitness.</p><p>However, after his doping scandal, he lost all of his endorsement deals which cost him more than $75 million.</p><p>As he was banned from professional racing due to allegations that he used steroids.</p><p>Along with his endorsement deals, Lance was forced to give up his seven Tour de France medals.</p><h3>Investments</h3><p>Apart from investing in real estate, Lance also invested in a company that would later deliver him a multi-million dollars fortune.</p><p>At a time, Lance was having a hard time in terms of finance, but his investment in a ride-sharing company Uber saved his family financially.</p><p>As he stated in one of the interviews, he invested about $100,000 in Uber when the company was valued at only $3.7 million.</p><p>During that time, he was making a ton of money from his endorsement deals and cycling career.</p><p>He did not even have any idea what Uber was at that point in time.</p><p>Currently, Uber has a total market value of $120 billion. Even though we do not know the actual number about how much Lance earned from the investment, but it’s presumably pretty valuable today.</p><p>Some sources even claim that Lance made over billion dollars from the investment, but that would be completely untrue.</p><p>Lance’s Uber investment is not more than $30 million today.</p><p>Probably even less than that with the tax cuts and other government charges.</p><p>But we cannot deny that the investment was just $100,000 and is worth more than $20 million after taxes. Pretty Impressive.</p><h3>Book Publications</h3><p>During the course of his career, Lance has authored numerous books.</p><p>On May 22, 2000, his first book titled <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>It’s Not About The Bike</strong></a>, which Sally Jenkins co-authored.</p><p>The book is the autobiography and highlights his Tour de France wins and drugs allegations.</p><p>Similarly, Lance published his second book in 2001 titled<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong> Lance Armstrong Performance program</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lance-Armstrong-Boook.jpg><p>The book highlights his comeback after retirement and his battle against testicular cancer.</p><p>Likewise, on October 7, 2003, Lance published <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Every Second Counts</strong></a>.</p><p>Furthermore, his other books include <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Images of Champion</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Lance Armstrong</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>A Survivors Story</strong></a>,&nbsp; and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>The Official Tour de France</strong></a>.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Lance began his sporting career as a swimmer ad the age of 12 at the city of Plano Swim Club and completed fourth in Texas state 1,500-meter freestyle.</p><p>Armstrong started his professional career with Motorola Cycling Team, the successor of the 7-Eleven team, in 1992.</p><p>Lance won 10 one-day events and stage races, but his breakthrough victory was the World Road Race championship which was held in Norway in 1993.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Lance-Armstrong-2021.jpg><p>He took his first win at the Tour de France on the stage from Chalons-sur-Marne to Verdu, which was before his world championships win.</p><p>Lace won the Thrift Drug Classic and came second in the Tour DuPont in the United States in 1994.</p><p>Later in his career, he would win seven Tour de France and make history.</p><p>However, after testing for doping, it was proved that he used performance enhancement drugs, so he gave up all the medals.</p><h2>Unknown Facts About Lance Armstrong</h2><ul><li>Lance started a podcast, The Move, in 2017, which was focused on the coverage of the Tour de France.</li><li>On January 17, 2013, In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Oprah Winfrey,&nbsp;</a>Armstrong&nbsp;admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during his cycling career.</li><li>Nike terminated its contract with Armstrong on October 17, 2012.</li><li>Lance finished 23rd place at his final Tour de France in 2010.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Is Lance Armstrong free of cancer?</h3><p>In February 1997, Armstrong was declared cancer-free.</p><h3>Did Lance Armstrong lose all his medals?</h3><p>Yes, Lance returned his medal because of his use of drugs.
