Recently Gerard has been working on his solo album, which is going to be released in September. So how rich is Gerard Way? It has been estimated that Gerard’s net worth is 28 million dollars. There is also a high chance that Gerard Way’s net worth will become even higher in the future as he continues his career as a musician and is planning to release his solo album.</p><h3>Gerard Way Net Worth $28 Million</h3><p>Gerard Arthur Way, or simply known as Gerard Way, was born in 1977, in New Jersey. From a very young age, Gerard was interested in music and the artists that influenced him the most are Iron Maiden, Queen, The Smiths, The Misfits and others. When Way was only 8 years old, he got his first guitar. Despite the fact that Gerard was very interested in music, at first he decided to focus more on an art career. Later Gerard decided to become musician and in 2001 the band known as My Chemical Romance was created. The members of the group were Ray Toro, Mikey Way, Frank Iero and James Dewees. The group became really successful after a short period of time and this had a huge impact on the growth of Gerard Way’s net worth. My Chemical Romance had released 4 albums: I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, The Black Parade, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge and Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys. All these albums were successful and added to Gerard’s net worth.</p><p>In addition to this, Gerard has also worked with other artists. For example he has worked with a Kyosuke Himuro, a Japanese singer. What is more, Gerard was the executive producer of Lost Alone’s album, entitled I’m a UFO in This City. This also made Way’s net worth grow.</p><p>As mentioned before, Gerard is not only a well known musician but he is also a comic book writer. He was 16 years old when he tried writing comic for the first time. The comic books that were written by Gerard became famous and acclaimed by others. So it could be said that Gerard is a really talented personality. In 2001 Gerard together with Joe Boyle created the cartoon entiled The Breakfast Monkey. He also was a part of The Anti-Bats!. These activities also made Gerard Way’s net worth higher.</p><p>All in all, it could be said that Gerard is a very talented musician and comic book writer. He has many fans all over the world because of the unique style of music that he creates and of course because of charisma on stage. It is a pity that My Chemical Romance has split up, but Way’s fans will be able to enjoy his music in the future as he is planning to start his career as a solo artist.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=24.94674556213><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Gerard Way</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$28 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 9, 1977</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Newark, New Jersey, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Musician, Writer, Singer, Music executive</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Education</td><td>School of Visual Arts, Belleville High School, No Shows, Action Cat, Drugstore Perfume</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Lyn-Z (m. 2007)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Bandit Lee Way</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Parents</td><td>Donna Lee Way, Donald Way, No Shows, Action Cat, Drugstore Perfume</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Mikey Way</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Gerard Arthur Way , Uncle Jiggy , Gee , My Chemical Romance</td></tr><tr readability=0.39024390243902><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/gerardway</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/gerardway</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.41860465116279><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/gerardway</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm2007553</a></td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Awards</td><td>Kerrang!

It's fun. My Sims family is called the Cholly family. I don't know why I picked that name; it's kind of random. The teenage daughter is my favorite, because I just had her go through this Goth phase.

Like, you should never want to hurt yourself. You should love yourself. Sometimes you have to kind of die inside in order to rise from your own ashes and believe in yourself and love yourself and become a new person and I think that that is going to be a lot of what the next record is about, not to plug it or anything.
