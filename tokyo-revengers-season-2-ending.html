<time>31 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Takemichi travels to the past in the thirteenth episode of Tokyo Revengers season 2 or “Tokyo Revengers: Christmas Showdown,” where he tries to come to terms with the truth that Mikey passed away in his arms and he ultimately killed everyone. He tells Chifuyu about his painful experiences, and the two of them work to determine what caused the weird occurrences in the future. Even though Takemichi eventually finds a comedic solution to the issue, things quickly go out of hand when a gang by the name of Tenjiku begins unexpectedly targeting Tonman members. Here is all the information you require on the conclusion of episode 13 of “Tokyo Revengers: Christmas Showdown” from season 2 of the television series. Spoilers follow.</p><h3>Tokyo Revengers Season 2 Finale Recap</h3><p>Takemichi returns to the past and starts working hard to get stronger after witnessing Mikey suffocate in his arms. He is sentimental, but he is also driven by a burning desire to have the strength necessary to save everyone. Chifuyu naturally becomes intrigued when he sees his friend hitting a tyre repeatedly in the rain and goes up to ask what occurred. Even Chifuyu finds it difficult to comprehend what prompted Mikey to make such extreme decisions once Takemichi exposes the facts. Takemichi, meantime, has made up his mind that he wants to take over as the Toman gang’s leader so that he can stop Mikey.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/14edaccccccacasaf-1.jpg alt="tokyo revengers season 3,tokyo revengers season 2 episode 13 bilibili,tokyo revengers season 2 ending,tokyo revengers season 2 ending song,tokyo revengers season 2 ending explained,tokyo revengers season 2 ending theme,tokyo revengers season 2 ending lyrics,will there be a season 2 of tokyo revengers,is there a season 2 of tokyo revengers,what is the ending of tokyo revengers,does tokyo revengers have a good ending,does tokyo revengers have season 2" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The two pals speculate about Mikey’s weird actions later at the public bathhouse. They come to the conclusion that there is a possibility that Kisaki’s expulsion from Toman may be connected to the entire situation. Later, Takemichi informs Chifuyu that he has discovered a technique to boost his strength and finally take control of Toman. To elevate his status in Toman, he discusses his intentions to overthrow the Yokohama gang. Unfortunately for Takemichi, Chifuyu finds his plan to be extremely humorous and just turns around and leaves, refusing to assist him in any way.</p><p>The two companions are unaware that the Toman members are already being attacked by the Tenjiku gang from Yokohama. It comes out that they made such dramatic decisions not long after Kisaki decided to join them and decide to exact some type of retaliation. Members of Tenjiku had previously assaulted Akkun and others, and when they find out that Takemichi knows them, they try to assault him as well. Fortunately, Chifuyu steps in to save them, begins battling Tenjiku members on his own, and orders his friends to run for their lives.</p><h3>Tokyo Revengers Season 2 Finale Ending: Does Takemichi and His Friends Defeat Tenjiku? What Happens to Chifuyu?</h3><p>Takemichi and his pals have escaped the school through the back entrance, and they are frantically trying to run as far as they can to get away. Takemichi reveals that he chose to stay behind to confront the criminals who have attacked them when Kazushi asks about Chifuyu. At that point, Kazushi explains that the attackers are members of the Tenjiku gang who chose to surround and beat up Toman members. Even worse, as Akkun regains consciousness, he informs Takemichi that 300 Tenjiku members are currently present in Tokyo.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2142fsavas-1.jpg alt="tokyo revengers season 3,tokyo revengers season 2 episode 13 bilibili,tokyo revengers season 2 ending,tokyo revengers season 2 ending song,tokyo revengers season 2 ending explained,tokyo revengers season 2 ending theme,tokyo revengers season 2 ending lyrics,will there be a season 2 of tokyo revengers,is there a season 2 of tokyo revengers,what is the ending of tokyo revengers,does tokyo revengers have a good ending,does tokyo revengers have season 2" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Takemichi was understandably concerned about Chifuyu in light of his decision to take on the vicious gang by himself. Then he orders Akkun and the rest to keep fleeing, before running back to assist his close friend. He hasn’t even gotten very far, though, before one of the Tenjiku members knocks him to the ground. The gang begins beating him up because he is all by himself, but fortunately Akkun and the others have stayed put despite Takemichi’s orders to go. They come to his aid and promise to fight beside him.</p><p>Even though Takemichi and his comrade fought the Tenjiku gang with great bravery, they were eventually so badly battered that they could not stand. As if things couldn’t get any worse, Takemichi is startled to find Kisaki coming towards him as he lay on the ground struggling to remain conscious. He has more questions than ever when Kisaki refers to him as the hero. Despite the fact that the episode closes there, we know from the manga that Kisaki does not linger for long before departing. The Twin Devils save Takemichi and Chifuyu when they are reunited.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="tokyo revengers season 3,tokyo revengers season 2 episode 13 bilibili,tokyo revengers season 2 ending,tokyo revengers season 2 ending song,tokyo revengers season 2 ending explained,tokyo revengers season 2 ending theme,tokyo revengers season 2 ending lyrics,will there be a season 2 of tokyo revengers,is there a season 2 of tokyo revengers,what is the ending of tokyo revengers,does tokyo revengers have a good ending,does tokyo revengers have season 2" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
