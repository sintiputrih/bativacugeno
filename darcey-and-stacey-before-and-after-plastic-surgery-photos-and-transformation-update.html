Continue reading the article to explore their transformation and pictures.</strong></p><p>Darcey and Stacey are two sisters who are currently making headlines due to their surgeries. This is not the first time the two sisters have received media attention; they have also received attention for previous surgeries.</p><p>They are well-known as the star of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. And are currently hosting their own shows, Darcey & Stacey on TLC since August 16, 2020</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darcey-and-stacey-before-and-after-plastic-surgery-photos></span>Darcey And Stacey Before and After Plastic Surgery: Photos<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Darcey and Stacey&nbsp;before&nbsp;and after plastic surgery pictures will shock you. The Silva twin sisters’ appearance is drastically altered as a result of a series of plastic surgeries.</p><p>You can find several pictures of them online showing their transformation. And many people believe that they were beautiful even before the surgery.</p><p>One of their fans&nbsp;commented, “They are trying so hard to look half their age that they have destroyed their looks and turned themselves into cheap-looking freaks. I’d be furious if I’d spent the money these girls have and ended up looking like they do now.”</p><p>We can only speculate on how lovely they would have been if they had aged naturally. They were stunning in their youth photographs. They appear to be much older than they are,&nbsp;another&nbsp;mentioned.</p><p>However, it is their personal choice, and we cannot judge them on that basis.</p><p>Cosmetic surgery is like an addiction, after a few months, you’ll find something else to “improve.” It never ends until you face some serious medical problems as a result of the surgeries or have a close experience.</p><p>They begin with a mommy makeover that includes tummy tucks and breast implants.</p><p>And so, with their second surgery, they created something new because they wanted to lift everything on their body. Including their nose, boobs, and lips, in order to feel softer and lighter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darcey-and-stacey-transformation-update></span>Darcey And Stacey Transformation Update<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Darcey and Stacey have an amazing transformation followed by several cosmetic surgeries. Before the 90-Day Fiancé, the 90 Days star recently debuted a new look on social media, displaying taut skin, feline eyes, and a plump pout.</p><p>“I started this journey for a mommy makeover and it’s an inner, outer transformation just to feel healthy and maintenance for my age,” Darcey told Life & Style in 2019.</p><p>Darcey and Stacey were soon spotted getting “another cosmetic procedure”,&nbsp; a cold laser therapy treatment focusing on their abs. The injections were soon followed by fillers beneath the 90 Day Fiancé stars’ eyes and lips. “I love it, it’s the old Darcey,” Darcey&nbsp;exclaims.</p><p>In an interview with US&nbsp;Weekly, the twin has disclosed all of their surgeries performed till now. They also revealed that they have done veneers to their teeth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=view-on-darcey-and-stacey-cosmetic-surgery></span>View On Darcey and Stacey Cosmetic Surgery<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Darcey and Stacey’s cosmetic surgery has both negative and positive responses on social media. Some respect their personal choice and the application of new scientific advances in making you feel more confident in yourself.</p><p>While some are opposed to their decision and opposed to the entire concept of plastic surgery. They believe that naturalness is always beautiful.</p><p>Beauty lies in the flaw.</p><p>Similarly, there are some people who are genuinely concerned about Silva’s twins and their daughter.</p><p>“Darcey’s daughters, hopefully, will not follow in her footsteps. They are already stunning, so there is no need to taint their features with a slew of fillers”, one of the followers wished.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyRp7CmxYyapZ1lo6mupLHYZpmenp%2Bnsm6tzZ1kmp6kmr9uvMuaqq2hk2LAtr7GnqmyZaCdvLW70maYp5xdqb%2BiutKfpqulkam2sLqMrqedmaSafA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdarcey-and-stacey-before-and-after-plastic-surgery-photos-and-transformation-update.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdarcey-and-stacey-before-and-after-plastic-surgery-photos-and-transformation-update.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdarcey-and-stacey-before-and-after-plastic-surgery-photos-and-transformation-update.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdarcey-and-stacey-before-and-after-plastic-surgery-photos-and-transformation-update.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdarcey-and-stacey-before-and-after-plastic-surgery-photos-and-transformation-update.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdarcey-and-stacey-before-and-after-plastic-surgery-photos-and-transformation-update.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./maitreyi-ramakrishnan-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./maitreyi-ramakrishnan-2.html>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Family, Net Worth, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./charlie-day-height.html>Charlie Day Height</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./charlie-day-height.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
