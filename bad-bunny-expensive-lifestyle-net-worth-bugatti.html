The performer's net worth is impressive, and he has spent some of his money on some truly wild things.</p><p>Let's take a look at Bad Bunny and one of the biggest purchases that he has made.</p><h2 id=bad-bunny-is-a-music-superstar>Bad Bunny Is A Music Superstar</h2><p>Bad Bunny represents one of the biggest names in the music industry at the moment, and the man has made it big thanks to years of hard work. He was not an overnight success by any means, but once he had the chance to taste mainstream popularity, he seized his moment and never looked back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things have progressively gotten bigger for the artist, and the fans that have been around since the early days are genuinely thrilled with the global fame that he has achieved with his music.</p><p>When summarizing Bad Bunny's colossal 2020 campaign, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> wrote, "By 2020, Bad Bunny was one of the most popular artists in the world. He performed at the Super Bowl halftime show, and he was also featured on the cover of "Rolling Stone" magazine. Capitalizing on this success, Bad Bunny released his second studio album in 2020, entitled 'YHLQMDLG.'"</p><p>His rise to global superstardom has been an absolute whirlwind, and audiences expect that he will only continue to rise as he keeps dropping chart-topping songs that millions will stream.</p><p>Thanks to finding plenty of success in the entertainment industry, Bad Bunny has been able to amass quite the personal fortune.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bad Bunny Stuns Fans With His Japanese Lyrics In 'Yonaguni'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-has-a-net-worth-of-18-million>He Has A Net Worth Of $18 Million</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Bad Bunny is currently sporting a net worth of $18 million, which is quite impressive for the performer. Sure, there are other musicians who are worth more, but considering the hype the Bad Bunny generates on a regular basis, we imagine that this number will only continue to rise.</p><p>As we mentioned already, Bad Bunny effectively conquered the world of music and became one of the hottest names on the globe. Even before turning into a global superstar, the man was generating some serious tour revenue back in 2018, when his La Nueva Religión Tour Part I and Part II hauled in more than $16 million worldwide, according to Billboard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bad Bunny is at the top of his game, and his bank account reflects that.

Well, we may not have a detailed rap sheet of every little thing that he has gotten his hands on, but one thing we do know is that Bad Bunny has shelled out some of his cash on cars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hola</a>, "After posting photos next to a modest Toyota Corolla, the international superstar revealed that he bought the 2003 model after trading in his exclusive Bugatti Chiron Sports 110 Ans, which is valued at almost $4 million. He bought the later to make an appearance at the 2020 Grammy Awards, and since then, he’s decided to take a more modest route with his vehicle choice."</p><p>Yes, he swapped it out, but we cannot simply brush past the fact that the man dropped a whopping $4 million on a single car. It is, however, interesting to see that he went so far in the other direction with the 2003 Corolla.</p><p>The performer detailed why he made the trade, saying, "At heart, I didn’t know what to do with the car, because I brought it to Puerto Rico and it was a piece of paper to guide it, everything was a problem: insurance, the government, taxes. Now, I have it in the United States. Here, I could not have it for another minute because when I would make my way through the streets, they knew it was me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About How Bad Bunny Came Up With His Stage Name</a></span></p><p>After making a massive purchase like the $4 million Bugatti Chiron, fans will be keeping an eye on Bad Bunny to see if he walks down the luxury car path again in the future.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Bad Bunny Teases New Music And Possible Collabs With BTS And Harry Styles' Vogue Cover</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZmpxdl8KvuthmnLGolaPAqsLEZqOinpWowbq4xGalnqxdrLyzwMdmma6fkanBqns%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbad-bunny-expensive-lifestyle-net-worth-bugatti.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbad-bunny-expensive-lifestyle-net-worth-bugatti.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbad-bunny-expensive-lifestyle-net-worth-bugatti.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbad-bunny-expensive-lifestyle-net-worth-bugatti.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbad-bunny-expensive-lifestyle-net-worth-bugatti.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbad-bunny-expensive-lifestyle-net-worth-bugatti.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ehiku-rademacher.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ehiku-rademacher.html>Ehiku Rademacher</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sadesbullet-proof-soul-lyrics.html>SadesBullet Proof Soul Lyrics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sadesbullet-proof-soul-lyrics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
