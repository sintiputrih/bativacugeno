However, most wrestling fans remember Runnels for her run in <a href=#><strong>WWE</strong></a>, which lasted from 1996 to 2004.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Best Managers From WWE's New Generation Era (& 5 Worst)</a></span></p><p>Working as a manager, in-ring competitor, TV host, and backstage interviewer, Terri Runnels has done nearly everything a performer can do on pro wrestling television. Fans might not know much about her, so let’s take a look at the essentials of Runnels’ pro wrestling career.</p><h2 id=debuted-in-wwe-as-goldust-rsquo-s-manager-marlena><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Debuted In WWE As Goldust’s Manager, Marlena</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Goldust-Marlena.jpg><p>Terri Runnels married Dustin Rhodes in 1993 and ended up joining him in WWE after he signed on in 1995 and became Goldust. Runnels’ debut came in early 1996 when she made her debut at Royal Rumble 1996 under the ring name Marlena. With Goldust having a cinema theme in addition to his androgynous gimmick, Marlena functioned as a director of sorts <a href=#>as his manager</a>, smoking a cigar at ringside and giving Goldust direction during matches. On top of that, Marlena reflected Goldust’s gimmick by wearing gold dresses and carrying gold items.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=terri-runnels-created-marlena><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Terri Runnels Created Marlena</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Marlena-and-Goldust.jpg><p>The concept for the Marlena character didn’t come from any member of WWE creative, but rather from <a href=#>Terri Runnels herself</a>. Inspired by actress Marlene Dietrich and fashion designer Bob Mackie’s special “Sun Goddess” Barbie doll as well as her own enjoyment of cigars, Runnels pitched the concept to her husband, who in turn encouraged her to pitch it to WWE. In recent years, figures like infamous WWE stooge Bruce Prichard have credited the character to Vince McMahon, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Runnels stresses that it was her idea</a>.</p><h2 id=goldust-amp-brian-pillman-feuded-over-her><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Goldust & Brian Pillman Feuded Over Her</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Goldust-Brian-Pillman.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to character-specific managers like Marlena, it’s inevitable that a feud ensues over who gets to be associated with her, and in 1997 Goldust found himself in a rivalry with Brian Pillman for just that. However, Pillman would come out on top in the feud, beating Goldust at In Your House 17: Ground Zero and winning Marlena in the process.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Best Wrestlers Managed By Terri Runnels, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, Pillman tragically died in October of that year, putting an end to the storyline, which was to involve an in-ring wedding. To salvage the angle, a twist was devised where Goldust would end up leaving Marlena for Luna Vachon.</p><h2 id=member-of-the-pretty-mean-sisters><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Member Of The Pretty Mean Sisters</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pretty-Mean-Sisters.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1998, Terri Runnels would find a new gimmick, first as the kayfabe lover of Val Venis until she said she was pregnant and he dumped her. From there, she formed a faction with two other disgruntled women, Jacqueline and Ryan Shamrock to form the Pretty Mean Sisters. Extremely <a href=#>Attitude Era in its execution</a>, the Sisters had a provocative acronym and gained a sex slave in Shawn Stasiak, who was dubbed simply Meat. Meat would prove to be the undoing of the group, as Runnels’ obsession with him would cause Jacqueline to ditch the group.</p><h2 id=the-miscarriage-angle><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Miscarriage Angle</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/terri-runnels-miscarriage.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Terri Runnels’ pregnancy angle wasn’t just impetus for the formation of the Pretty Mean Sisters, but also a storyline unto itself. The Sisters ended up aligning with D’Lo Brown and Mark Henry, but Brown accidentally knocked Runnels off of the ring apron during a match <a href=#>on an episode of Raw</a>, forcing her to suffer an apparent miscarriage. From there, Brown was compelled to carry out the Pretty Mean Sisters’ bidding — that is, until he found out that Terri was never pregnant.</p><h2 id=managed-the-hardy-boyz><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Managed The Hardy Boyz</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/terri-runnels-hardy-boyz.jpg><p>By the end of 1999, Terri Runnels was looking to gain new clients and held a best-of-five series between The Hardy Boyz and the team of Edge and Christian called the Terri Invitational Tournament, with the winner <a href=#>gaining Runnels as a manager</a> and a large sum of money. Matt and Jeff Hardy ended up winning the final bout, a Ladder Match at the pay-per-view No Mercy. But after several months, Runnels would betray them and side with Edge and Christian anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=feuded-with-the-kat><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Feuded With The Kat</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/the-kat.jpg><p>Not all of Terri Runnels’ pro wrestling exploits involved her functioning as a manager. In 2000, she got into a rivalry with The Kat, resulting in a Catfight at WrestleMania 2000, a match that, in addition to being provocative, involved an “over the top rope” elimination, which Runnels won thanks to her corner woman The Fabulous Moolah pulling The Kat out during a referee distraction.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 WWE Women's Wrestling Match Types We Will Never See Again</a></span></p><p>Several more gimmick matches between Runnels and Kat ensued, including a Stink Face match at SummerSlam later that year, wherein the winner was the one to perform the Stink Face maneuver on her opponent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=managed-the-radicalz><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Managed The Radicalz</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/terri-runnels-saturn-malenko.jpg><p>That same year, Terri Runnels forged an on-screen romance with former WCW wrestler Perry Saturn and thus became aligned with Saturn’s faction, <a href=#>The Radicalz</a>, managing Saturn and joining the group in mixed tag team matches against The Hardy Boyz and Lita, who formed Team Xtreme. However, when a kayfabe head injury caused Saturn to fixate upon a mop he named Moppy, he left Runnels in favor of the inanimate object. In response, Terri began to manage Raven, who stole Moppy and threw it into a woodchipper.</p><h2 id=became-a-host-amp-backstage-interviewer><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Became A Host & Backstage Interviewer</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/terri-runnels-batista-randy-orton.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The early 2000s saw Terri Runnels venture from managing and wrestling into broadcasting roles, joining Jonathan Coachman to become a co-host of the <a href=#>totally forgotten WWE Excess</a>, replacing the previous co-host Trish Stratus. In addition to being a recap show, Excess also aired some classic matches. Runnels’ run with the show lasted until Excess changed format in April of 2002 and was canceled the following month. That wasn’t Runnels’ only broadcasting gig in WWE — she also started working as a backstage interviewer on Raw.</p><h2 id=wrestled-sporadically-before-being-released><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Wrestled Sporadically Before Being Released</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/terri-runnels-hardcore-title.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite her broadcasting positions with WWE, Terri Runnels did also step into the ring from time to time. As to be expected of the women’s division of the era, Runnels was no stranger to gimmick matches, competing with Trish Stratus in a wet T-shirt contest and taking on Stacy Keibler in a Lingerie Pillow Fight. She even briefly dethroned Stevie Richards to capture the Hardcore Championship. However, in March of 2004, WWE released a whole slew of talent, including Terri Runnels, who hasn’t wrestled since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmekmr%2BztYyrrKemlaHAbsPWnmScmaKasrN5zJqppZ2elnq1vsivoJpllpawtb%2BO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fterri-runnels-wwe-career-marlena-trivia-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fterri-runnels-wwe-career-marlena-trivia-facts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fterri-runnels-wwe-career-marlena-trivia-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fterri-runnels-wwe-career-marlena-trivia-facts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fterri-runnels-wwe-career-marlena-trivia-facts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fterri-runnels-wwe-career-marlena-trivia-facts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./soookawaii.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./soookawaii.html>Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mrhurriicane.html>MrHurriicane</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mrhurriicane.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
