Nevada, known for its vibrant entertainment scene and famous Las Vegas strip, has also produced several exceptional basketball players. From high school legends to NBA superstars, let's take a closer look at some of the top basketball players born in Nevada.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Stephen Curry</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Born in Akron, Ohio, Stephen Curry spent his formative years in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father played for the Charlotte Hornets. However, many may be surprised to learn that this two-time NBA MVP and three-time NBA champion was actually born in Akron, Ohio. Curry's birthplace is often overshadowed by his connection to North Carolina, where he attended college and became a star. Nonetheless, Nevada can proudly claim Stephen Curry as one of its own.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Klay Thompson</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another member of the famed Golden State Warriors dynasty, Klay Thompson was born in Los Angeles, California, but spent his early years in Lake Oswego, Oregon. However, his roots can be traced back to Nevada, as he was born to Mychal Thompson, a former NBA player who was born and raised in Nassau, Bahamas but spent significant time in Reno, Nevada. Klay Thompson's incredible shooting ability and defensive prowess have solidified his status as one of the top players in the NBA.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Kenny Dobbs</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kenny Dobbs, born in Phoenix, Arizona, moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, during his high school years. Known for his incredible dunking ability, Dobbs gained widespread recognition after winning the Sprite Slam Dunk Contest in 2012. His innovative and acrobatic dunks captivated audiences and solidified his status as one of the best dunkers in the world. Dobbs' journey from Phoenix to Las Vegas showcases the impact that Nevada has had on his basketball career.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>C.J. Watson</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>C.J. Watson, born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, had a successful career as a point guard in the NBA. After playing college basketball at the University of Tennessee, Watson went on to have stints with multiple NBA teams, including the Golden State Warriors, Chicago Bulls, and Brooklyn Nets. Known for his steady play and ability to contribute off the bench, Watson's journey from Las Vegas to the NBA serves as an inspiration for aspiring basketball players in Nevada.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Luke Babbitt</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Luke Babbitt, another Las Vegas native, had a successful college career at the University of Nevada, Reno before entering the NBA. Known for his sharpshooting and versatility, Babbitt played for several teams in the NBA, including the Portland Trail Blazers and the New Orleans Pelicans. His ability to stretch the floor and knock down three-pointers made him a valuable asset to his teams. Babbitt's success is a testament to the basketball talent that Nevada has produced over the years.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Jackie Robinson</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>While Jackie Robinson is primarily remembered for breaking the color barrier in Major League Baseball, many may not know that he was also a talented basketball player. Born in Cairo, Georgia, Robinson moved to Pasadena, California, during his high school years. However, he spent a significant amount of time in Reno, Nevada, where he played basketball for the Reno Red Devils, a semi-professional team. Although his basketball career didn't reach the same heights as his baseball career, Robinson's impact on the game cannot be overlooked.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Jordan Caroline</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jordan Caroline, born in Champaign, Illinois, moved to Nevada during his high school years. He played college basketball for the University of Nevada, Reno, where he showcased his versatility and tenacity on the court. Caroline's ability to contribute in various aspects of the game, including scoring, rebounding, and defense, made him a fan favorite. After college, he had a short stint in the NBA G League before continuing his professional career overseas. Caroline's time in Nevada left a lasting impact on the basketball community.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Nevada has produced a diverse group of talented basketball players who have made their mark at various levels of the game. From NBA superstars like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson to high-flying dunkers like Kenny Dobbs, these players have showcased their skills and represented Nevada with pride. Their success serves as an inspiration for aspiring basketball players in the state and highlights the rich basketball tradition that exists in Nevada. As the sport continues to grow in popularity, it will be exciting to see who the next generation of top basketball players from Nevada will be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn6hlkaeybsDHnmStp6Bir6K%2Fyp6rm5mcoXqxuMCynKurXZe8s7qMoqVmppWrrqWt</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-the-top-basketball-players-born-in-nevada.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-the-top-basketball-players-born-in-nevada.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-the-top-basketball-players-born-in-nevada.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-the-top-basketball-players-born-in-nevada.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-the-top-basketball-players-born-in-nevada.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-the-top-basketball-players-born-in-nevada.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./christian-guzman-height-and-weight-girlfriend-heidi-somers-instagram-wiki-biography-parents-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./christian-guzman-height-and-weight-girlfriend-heidi-somers-instagram-wiki-biography-parents-html.html>Christian Guzman Height and Weight, Girlfriend Heidi Somers, Instagram, Wiki, Biography, Parents</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./strawberry-salad.html>Strawberry Salad with Balsamic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./strawberry-salad.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
