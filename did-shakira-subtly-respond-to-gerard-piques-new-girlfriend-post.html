The singer seemingly clapped back at her longtime boyfriend, Gerard Piqué, after the two announced their split in June. <a href=#>The couple had been together since 2010 but in a joint statement</a>, confirmed their split."We regret to confirm that we are separating. We ask for privacy at this moment for the well-being of our children, who are our maximum priority. Thank you in advance for your understanding and respect."The couple first met on set for Shakira's song "Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)" music video. The hit song was the official track for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and multiple players made a cameo, including Gerard Piqué.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 9 Biggest Controversies Of Colombian Popstar Shakira</a></span>Shakira, speaking to <a href=#>60 minutes</a> in 2020, recalled the first time she saw Piqué, "I wasn't a soccer fan, so I didn't know who he was. When I saw the video, I was like, 'Hmm, that one's kind of cute. 'And then someone decided to introduce us.'"The pair share two sons, Milan, age nine, and Sasha, age seven.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-shakira-respond-to-gerard-piqu-eacute-s-new-girlfriend>How Did Shakira Respond to Gerard Piqué's New Girlfriend?</h2><p>A day after Piqué went public with his girlfriend Clara Chia Marti, age 23—twelve years younger than Piqué, who is 35—Shakira released a video of herself dancing and singing. Shakira is 22 years older than Marti.</p><p>In the video, Shakira is singing along to her new song, which is being called a diss track, "BZRP Music Sessions Vol. 53," a collaboration with Argentine DJ and producer Bizarrap.</p><p>Shakira captioned her post, “Las mujeres ya no lloran las mujeres bailan merengue!” Which translates to, "Women don't cry anymore, women dance merengue!" which is similar to her hit single's lyrics of "Women don't cry anymore, they cash in."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The song has been widely speculated that this is Shakira's direct response to Piqué, the separation, and him having a new girlfriend already. In the song, Shakira sings, "I'm not getting back with you, don't cry for me, nor beg me/ I understood that it's not my fault that they criticize you/ I only make music, sorry that it bothers you."</p><p>"BZRP Music Sessions Vol. 53" also has the lyrics, "Good luck with my so-called replacement/ I don't even know what happened/You're acting so weird, I don't even recognize you/I'm worth two 22-year-olds/ You traded in a Ferrari for a Twingo/ You traded in a Rolex for a Casio."</p><h2 id=why-did-shakira-and-gerard-piqu-eacute-breakup>Why Did Shakira and Gerard Piqué Breakup?</h2><p>The pair never got married despite being together for 11 years and sharing two children. In 2020, the duo did a <a href=#>60 Minutes</a> interview where they talked about their decision never to marry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shakira said, "To tell you the truth, marriage scares me. I don't want him to see me as the wife. I'd rather him see me as his girlfriend," she said. Piqué agreed, adding: "The girlfriend."</p><p>Shakira, laughing and saying being a girlfriend is like "forbidden fruit," continued, "I wanna keep him on his toes. I want him to think that anything's possible depending on behavior."</p><p>However, in 2022, Shakira appeared on the podcast "<a href=#>Planet Weirdo with Holly H</a>." There she spoke about the couple's struggles and what they tend to fight over. She said they argue about her lack of punctuality and time mismanagement.</p><p>"My poor husband, slash boyfriend, slash baby daddy, whatever you want to call him, he has to wait up for me so long. He's tired of waiting up," she said. "'Cause Colombian time is not the same as Catalonian time, Spanish time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She discussed how schedule-oriented Piqué is and how she isn't because her career consumes her entire life. "He's very strict, very punctual. He's been brought up in a football team where he's a team player, and he has to be [punctual]. It's like the army," Shakira said. "There is like a combination of an army slash kindergarten."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Did Shakira Date Before Pique?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-things-shakira-has-subtley-or-not-so-subtley-in-response-to-the-breakup>The Things Shakira Has Subtley, Or Not So Subtley, In Response To The Breakup</h2><p>After releasing the diss track about Piqué and his new girlfriend, <a href=#>Shakira aimed at a member of Piqué's family</a>. In early January 2023, she put out a terrifying life-size witch doll on her Spanish home balcony. The balcony reportedly looks into her former mother-in-law's house.</p><p>Furthermore, neighbors of Shakira's have reported that she is blasting her song "BZRP Music Sessions Vol. 53," further dissing Piqué's life choices. But the song also has a line about her former mother-in-law. She sings, "You left my mother-in-law as my neighbor, with the press at the door and the debt in the Treasury."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, Shakira has seemingly confirmed Piqué cheated on her. Her proof? The jam jar. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ShowNewsToday</a> reported that Shakira returned from a trip to discover someone had eaten her strawberry jam.</p><p>Supposedly, Piqué and their kids hate jam, so Shakira concludes that he is cheating. These allegations haven't been confirmed, but if true, that's a pretty crazy way to discover your partner's infidelity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqLWit8irmGarpZfBrcWMq5ysqJ%2BjsW7AzmaenqqRp7FuvMiqrJ6rXaOyuHnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjKmmrKxf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-shakira-subtly-respond-to-gerard-piques-new-girlfriend-post.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-shakira-subtly-respond-to-gerard-piques-new-girlfriend-post.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-shakira-subtly-respond-to-gerard-piques-new-girlfriend-post.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-shakira-subtly-respond-to-gerard-piques-new-girlfriend-post.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-shakira-subtly-respond-to-gerard-piques-new-girlfriend-post.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-shakira-subtly-respond-to-gerard-piques-new-girlfriend-post.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gene-wilder-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gene-wilder-net-worth.html>Gene Wilder Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dead-jim-morrison-no-fan-of-ke-html.html>Dead Jim Morrison No Fan of Ke$ha</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dead-jim-morrison-no-fan-of-ke-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
