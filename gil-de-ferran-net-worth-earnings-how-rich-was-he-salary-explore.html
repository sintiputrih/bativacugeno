<time>23 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Racing enthusiasts all around the world are grieving the passing of <strong>Gil De Ferran</strong> and are curious about his personal life, particularly his net worth. The former Indianapolis 500 champion rose to prominence as a driver and team owner. The world of motor racing has been rocked by the death of one of its biggest figures, Gil De Ferran. As a result, Gil’s personal information, such as his income and net worth, piques the interest of fans. Gil De Ferran was born in Paris, France, on November 11, 1967. However, since he was born in Brazil to Brazilian parents, he participated under their flag. Gil began kart racing at the age of 13 after being inspired by his idol, Emerson Fittipaldi. He subsequently moved to Formula Ford in 1987 and, by 1991, had advanced to Formula Three with Edenbridge Racing.</p><p>De Ferran won the title in 1992 after joining Paul Stewart Racing. This was the start of his remarkable career, which included victories in IndyCar racing, such as winning the Indianapolis 500 in 2003.&nbsp;Gil had three distinct periods as a Formula One manager, all with differing degrees of success, with BAR-Honda and McLaren. He has dabbled with team ownership with De Ferran Motorsports, which competes in the Le Mans Series.&nbsp;Gil was adored and revered across the racing industry for his bold approach on the race and his outgoing nature off the track.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gil-de-ferrans-salary-and-earnings></span>Gil De Ferran’s Salary and Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to most estimations, <strong>Gil De Ferran’s net worth</strong> is between $800,000 and $1.5 million. A major portion of his net worth may be attributed to his successful racing career. He earned more than $1.3 million as the winner of the 2003 Indy 500. Similarly, additional successful racing events contributed significantly to his total net worth and career profits.</p><p>In terms of income, we may estimate that he earned roughly $1 million while serving as McLaren’s sports director. Gil’s profits and personal worth are bolstered further by the success of his Le Mans outfit, De Ferran Motorsports. Gil has gained a lot of reputation and riches as one of the most successful racing drivers and managers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gil-de-ferran-passes-away-at-the-age-of-56></span>Gil De Ferran Passes Away At The Age Of 56<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Gil De Ferran</strong> died unexpectedly at the age of 56, leaving the racing world in sadness. According to the Brazilian Automobile Confederation (CBA), De Ferran had a heart attack last Friday at a private racing facility in Opa-Locka, Florida. Furthermore, they reported that he was rushed to a nearby hospital but did not survive.</p><p>To commemorate the occasion, racing icons and celebrities have sent homage and gratitude comments on social media. Gil’s outstanding career and services were recognized in a statement made by the McLaren F1 team.&nbsp;“Everyone at McLaren Racing is shocked and deeply saddened to learn that a beloved member of our McLaren family has passed away.” Gil was an essential member of our racing squad.”</p><p>Other notable figures, including as Martin Brundle and Roger Penske, have also expressed their sympathies. Brundle recalled Gil’s family and children. Roger, on the other hand, recalled the Brazilian for his professional achievements.&nbsp;Everyone in the motor racing world adored and appreciated Gil. The vacuum he has left in the sport will be difficult to replace. Furthermore, fans of the sport will remember his contributions to racing for the rest of their lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BZoXqlsYyfnKuqkaN6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqat0aegp5%2BjYrWww4yroJygXayutHnHnmSsmZyWv7p5xLGnpaeimnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgil-de-ferran-net-worth-earnings-how-rich-was-he-salary-explore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgil-de-ferran-net-worth-earnings-how-rich-was-he-salary-explore.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgil-de-ferran-net-worth-earnings-how-rich-was-he-salary-explore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgil-de-ferran-net-worth-earnings-how-rich-was-he-salary-explore.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgil-de-ferran-net-worth-earnings-how-rich-was-he-salary-explore.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgil-de-ferran-net-worth-earnings-how-rich-was-he-salary-explore.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./max-martin-net-worth-169291.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./max-martin-net-worth-169291.html>Max Martin Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./fans-compare-the-suspension-of-marcell-ozuna-over-domestic-violence-with-trevor-bauer.html>Fans Compare The Suspension Of Marcell Ozuna Over Domestic Violence With Trevor Bauer</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./fans-compare-the-suspension-of-marcell-ozuna-over-domestic-violence-with-trevor-bauer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
