He participated in a program in high school that allowed him to work a full-time job. After graduating high school, Daymond didn’t attend college and started a commuter van service to support his family financially.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You May Also Like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Tara Palmeri, 30-Age: From Birthday To Obscure Married Life Status And More" rel=follow>Tara Palmeri, 30-Age: From Birthday To Obscure Married Life Status And More</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr>The 49-year-old entrepreneur started FUBU (For Us By Us) in his mother’s house after learning to sew from his mother. FUBU’s wool ski hats with tops became an instant hit that sold for $10 each. Bringing some friends into the business, Daymond started sewing the FUBU logo on jerseys, sweatshirts, and t-shirts.</p><p dir=ltr>Eventually, they became known as a prominent apparel brand despite having a small company. Many stores started to request their brand, and in 1994, Daymond received an offer to participate at the Las Vegas fashion show, MAGIC. From then on the brand really took off and Daymond and family have never looked back ever since. The brand now boasts sales of over&nbsp;$6 billion worldwide. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr>Standing at the height of 5 feet and 7 inches, Daymond also provides&nbsp;motivational speeches about his rags to riches tale and inspires millions hoping to become an entrepreneur.

I was losing a friend every three months.

The music artists were as wealthy or more wealthy than crack dealers while selling music. While hip-hop was the social currency of the time and voice of the streets, Daymond took the brands that existed in those days and gave it his own spin.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Read Also:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Jennifer Ashton Divorced With Husband!

Daymond was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in March 2017 when he was undergoing an executive physical.

I know there are a lot of debates about if executive physicals are worth it or not, but in my case it was worth more than gold-or anything else-because it saved me from a lot of potential problems down the road.</p><p dir=ltr>As of now, Daymond is cancer-free and will have to get his thyroid checked regularly for the rest of his life. He further mentioned that he was relieved for not having to go through any pain or suffering and suggests that people have their health in check.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You Don't Want To Miss:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="What Is David Rubulotta Net Worth?
