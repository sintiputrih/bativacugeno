Since the world knew that Trebek had been battling stage IV pancreatic cancer for more than a year before his passing, everyone recognized that it was only a matter of time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/alex-trebek-pretending-like-he-is-going-to-throw-his-emmy-award.jpg><p>Even though Trebek's passing was expected, it hit many longtime Jeopardy! fans very hard. A beloved figure who'd been entering people's houses through their televisions for decades, Trebek seemed like the perfect Jeopardy! host.</p><p>Known for his often serious demeanor that lent the ultimate knowledge-based game show credibility, Trebek also notably had a good sense of humor. He was the kind of guy who in a moment of levity might pretend like he is about to throw the Emmy Award he just won.</p><p>Since Trebek seemed like the perfect Jeopardy! host and fans loved him so much, he seemed impossible to replace. Still, when Trebek passed away in 2020, the show had to go on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ryan Seacrest Made A Big Mistake Co-Hosting A Game Show With Kelly Ripa, And It Caused A 45-Minute Delay With Lawyers Getting Involved</a></span></p><p>Before Trebek passed away, he wanted CNN legal analyst Laura Coates to take over hosting Jeopardy! from him. However, Coates revealed that when she asked to guest host Jeopardy, she "was told 'no'". That left fans wondering who would take over Trebek's longtime gig.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jpg_20230823_223347_0000.jpg><p>After some drama, Ken Jennings and Mayim Bialik were selected to be Jeopardy!'s permanent rotating hosts. In 2022, Jennings was interviewed by Vulture about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">going from a Jeopardy! contestant to the host of the show</a>. During that interview, Jennings revealed how nervous he was when he was first asked to guest host the beloved game show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’d like to say it was an honor, but really, all of the emotions around that were just panic. He had done the job so perfectly for decades and suddenly, within weeks of his passing, I had to step in as a substitute. It was really nerve-wracking. It’s a difficult job. Even if I could figure out some of the rudiments of it, you’ve got an audience that doesn’t want to see me out there. And I totally get that. They wanted to see Alex. I still do, too, every night."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ken-jennings-looking-nervous.jpg><p>Jennings then went on to talk about the amazing gift he received from Alex Trebek's widow before he guest-hosted Jeopardy! following the former host's passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"One of the producers motioned to a little box that was sitting in front of me. I opened it and it was a little jewelry box with Alex’s cufflinks and a very kind note from Jean Trebek offering support. It must have been a super hard time for her, and she was thinking about the poor schmuck trying to do her late husband’s old job. That was such a lovely gesture."</p><p>Jennings also spoke about how he grew into his current role as one of Jeopardy!'s permanent hosts.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Were Pat Sajak And Vanna White Intensely Competitive Behind The Scenes At Wheel of Fortune?</a></span></p><p>"There was the panic of having to fill in for Alex, then there was so much relief when the shows aired and they seemed to go over well. The audience seemed to accept the idea of a guest host. By the time I had done my six weeks, I was like, 'You know what? This isn’t a bad idea. I feel like I could actually grow into this job and learn how to do it.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of the time of this writing, Jennings has been serving as Jeopardy!'s permanent rotating host for years. With that in mind, it is amazing to learn that he once believed he would never even be considered for the role.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/famous-jeopardy-contestants-james-holzhauer-brad-rutter-and-ken-jennings.jpg><p>In 2010, Jennings participated in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session. During that process, a fan asked Jennings about becoming Jeopardy!'s host. "Do you think you'll be asked to take over for Trebek when he retires? Would you do it?"</p><p>In response to that question, Jennings pretty much dismissed that idea at the time. Jennings also pretty much <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">argued why he shouldn't have even been considered for Trebek's job</a> back then. "I doubt I would be asked...wouldn't they be more likely to go with someone with, you know, actually hosting experience?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jpg_20230823_223459_0000.jpg><p>While Jennings didn't think he was the right man for the job in 2010, he did express how happy he would be for the opportunity. "That said, I would do it in a heartbeat. Talk about a dream job. That dude works like five days a month reading trivia questions (okay, "answers," YEESH) and makes millions. Plus millions of middle-aged cat ladies have sexy fantasies about him."</p><h2 id=were-alex-trebek-and-ken-jennings-friends>Were Alex Trebek And Ken Jennings Friends?</h2><p>During Ken Jennings' aforementioned Vulture interview, he was asked how he reacted to the amazing gift that Alex Trebek's widow gave him. Vulture's interviewer suggested the idea that Trebek's widow gave the cufflinks as a way of sponsoring Jennings as the person to succeed her husband.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Pat Sajak Flat-Out Refuse Wheel Of Fortune Contestants Who Were Taller Than Him?</a></span></p><p>In response to that suggestion, Jennings spoke about the relationship he had with Trebek. According to Jennings, he believed that Trebek was okay with the idea of him taking over Jeopardy!'s hosting duties.</p><p>"I don’t want to put words in anybody’s mouth, but over the years, I did get the sense that it was an idea that wouldn’t have annoyed Alex. He asked me to read his audiobook when his voice wasn’t up to doing every chapter towards the end. I felt like that was a very nice gesture of successorship that he didn’t have to make."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ken-jennings-and-alex-trebek-laughing-together.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennings also spoke to Vulture about the last conversation he had with Trebek. Based on how Jennings described that conversation, it certainly seemed like the two men were friendly. However, during his Vulture interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennings clarified the true nature of his relationship with Trebek</a>.</p><p>"Alex and I had a professional relationship. We weren’t, say, hanging out and going camping together, but every time I saw him, we got along well."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqeglr%2BlxYyhpqysXZa5psSMramempWgeqW1xJ1kpJ2eYremus2ipaCrXaeyra3Toqanq5ievXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-host-alex-trebek-died-ken-jennings-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjeopardy-host-alex-trebek-died-ken-jennings-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-host-alex-trebek-died-ken-jennings-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjeopardy-host-alex-trebek-died-ken-jennings-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-host-alex-trebek-died-ken-jennings-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-host-alex-trebek-died-ken-jennings-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dia-simms-on-her-start-with-combs-enterprises-1241038403659.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dia-simms-on-her-start-with-combs-enterprises-1241038403659.html>Dia Simms on her start with Combs Enterprises</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-turk-pettit-heres-everything-to-know-about-the-golfer.html>Who Is Turk Pettit?
