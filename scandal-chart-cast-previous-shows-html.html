First, you fall in love with <a href=#>Olivia’s wardrobe</a>. Then you experience the false sensation that Scandal is never on or is always a rerun. And the third stage, when you start to notice that you recognize everyone on the show from somewhere else. And it’s not just that the actors have popped up somewhere before, it’s that practically everybody involved with Olivia Pope and Associates (with the exception of star Kerry Washington and supporting player Guillermo Díaz) has appeared in at least one show in a very specific and limited set of six, which include The Good Wife, Gilmore Girls, Everwood, and Shonda Rhimes’s previous series. Behold the Overlapping Résumés of Scandal’s cast. A few notes before we dig in:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-015d2e37ca913a83248dd1d21b17fdbf-3-0-0@published data-word-count=100></p><ul><li>For this chart, “Sorkin World” includes all of the shows of Aaron Sorkin: <i>Sports Night, The West Wing, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</i>, and <i>Newsroom</i>. We grouped those shows together because there’s so much overlap between those series as it is. (No one overlaps from <i>Newsroom</i>, as it turns out, but we considered it.)</li><li>Obviously <i>Scandal, Grey’s Anatomy</i>, and <i>Private Practice </i>are all Shonda Rhimes shows and thus share a sensibility. They also share a casting director: Linda Lowy, who is married to Jeff Perry.</li><li>Some of these are admittedly very minor roles.
