Although the Chicago Police Department has yet to identify the victims of the shooting, <strong>Daniel O’Shea</strong>, the Deputy Chief for the department, confirmed during a press conference on Tuesday evening that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a shooting</a> did happen.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“At approximately 16:37 hours today, right here in the 100 block of East Oak Street, we had three individuals shopping,” O’Shea explained in the conference. “Two vehicles pulled up. Four individuals exited those vehicles, two from each vehicle, and began firing at the individuals that were on the sidewalk outside of one of the stores here. They also struck a female that was in one of the vehicles, which was also parked outside one of the stores here.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Right now we have one male, Black, 26 years old, transported to Northwestern Hospital, where he was pronounced deceased,” he continued. “We have one female, Black, 26 years old, who was also transported to a hospital.

He keeps his fans up to date on his career and sometimes shares personal moments on Instagram.</strong> In addition to posting about new music and live appearances, FBG Duck has posted memorable videos that stand out like two pics he took on his 26th birthday, which can be seen below, on Dec. 6. In them, he was standing and posing with his hands clasped together while looking grateful and happy. “<span>Definitely Enjoying My 26th Gday Thanks For The Gday Wishes Love y’all,” he wrote in the caption for the post.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-19><strong>4.
