There, he is seen in his most raw and unabashed self. Even though Lush is the icon of all things insane and hilarious, his journey to finding this stage was a rather rocky one, filled with anguish and trauma.</p><p>Growing up, his gay and vegan lifestyle attracted a lot of hate, especially from his mother and friends. The downtrodden eventually started looking for a friend over the internet. And to his relief, he found an online chat friend who lived across the state.</p><p>During this time, he fell in love with his first boyfriend and then created a ‘MySpace’ page. It was created just to post and share pictures of this newfound romance with the unknown internet clan. Before things could pick up the pace, his page found a boom of followers that loaded him with appreciation and love. And many of them even hailed him as the ‘Gay God.’</p><p>With an idea that struck him like a bolt, Lush changed his ‘MySpace’ name to ‘GayGod’. Soon after moving in with a friend, he started a YouTube channel. And then, uploaded eccentric videos that shot him to the 7th Most subscribed channel at that time.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-48287 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Matthew-Lush-video.jpg alt="Matthew Lush" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-48287 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Matthew Lush while making a YouTube video. Source: YouTube</p><h4>His further career</h4><p>He then moved to LA, after which his life took the most amazing turn. And he was surrounded by people who only showered him with love. Now gaining popularity as one of the biggest pro-LGBT YouTubers, his channel ‘GayGod’ now has over one million and counting subscribers.</p><p>A channel that is no less than uber-cool and may probably even come off as provocative. ‘GayGod’ is surely on its way to becoming the best one-of-a-kind pro-gay YouTube channel out there. It usually revolves around vlogs or videos of him lip-syncing to peppy songs and is also popular for uploads like ‘Coming Out’, ‘Death Threats’ and ‘For the Pervs.’</p><p>His channel ‘Lush’, has over 865K subscribers. It is an outlet for his wild thoughts like ‘I’m in love with a straight guy, and ‘Why I’m giving up on drinking’. No doubt these channels are making their way into the hearts of a wider number of fans by the passing day.</p><h2><span id=Matthew_Lush_8211_Personal_Life>Matthew Lush – Personal Life</span></h2><p>Lush is openly gay and is one of the most popular gay YouTubers of this generation with his enthusiastic pro-gay videos and his no-nonsense attitude.</p><p>Matthew is never one to keep his personal life hush-hush. Ever since he started a relationship with Nick Laws, his channel was brimming with PDA-overloaded videos and vlogs. And that didn’t hide any bit of their blooming romance.</p><p>The couple, unfortunately, called their relationship off. And Lush even shared a rather emotional video ‘Thoughts of committing suicide’, where he is seen overcome with a ton of emotions. They briefly dated for over two years. After a few months, he is seen in his ever-vibrant self again. And, in 2016, he began dating Chandler Murphy.</p><p>Moreover, according to some online sites, it came to know that he has also dated Connor Jon, and Max lately. As of now, he seems to be single and is focusing on his career.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-48284 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Matthew-Lush-ex.jpg alt="Matthew Lush" width=650 height=454 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-48284 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Matthew Lush and his ex-boyfriend, clicking a selfie.
