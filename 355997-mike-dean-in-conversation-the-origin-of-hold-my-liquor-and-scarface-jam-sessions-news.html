He's got a session later that afternoon. To prepare, he sits in his home studio bathed in blue light and with a lit joint never out of reach. When our conversation begins, he's actually in the middle of a Twitch stream. He's been creating music in real-time for his many fans, an experience he later describes as an&nbsp;addiction.&nbsp;It's clear that he can lose himself in the creative process. He's been doing so for decades, becoming one of hip-hop's most sought-after producers in the process.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He's been at the center of countless classic movements. Early in his career, Dean became the in-house engineer at Rap-A-Lot Records, where he developed creative chemistry with the legendary Scarface. Through their friendship -- and the many albums made along the way -- Dean found himself on Kanye West's radar after impressing Ye with his mix on "Guess Who's Back." What followed was a whirlwind ascent into a new era of production, fueled by vintage synthesizers and potent marijuana.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">To go in-depth on Dean's storied history would take far more than a few paragraphs. Instead, take a second to check out a transcription of our recent conversation --unconventionally scored by the faint sound of a beat-in-the-making-- recorded shortly after the release of his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">recent instrumental album </a><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">4:22</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As per, the interview is edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</p><p><h6>Steve Granitz/WireImage/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>HNHH:</strong> How you doing?</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Mike Dean:</strong> Good, man.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>That’s the home studio setup right there?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Nice.

Today I’m working with this kid named AJ Mitchell, a pop singer. Lot of shit in the chamber. The regular artists coming back around for another round you know.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Are you mixing, mastering, doing production?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Production for him. I’m executive producing the album.&nbsp;It’s been like six months you know.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Dope. Taking it back for a second. Can you walk me through the Texas landscape and how you first started getting into hip-hop?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah. I started working with these rappers&nbsp;called the Def Squad&nbsp;in a small town where I’m from in Texas. They're like my first exposure to producing hip hop. Before that I was into funk, you know P-funk with all the synthesizers and shit. Those guys exposed me to turntablism, scratching, sampling. When I started doing that, it was when The Geto Boys were first starting to bubble up. I’d hired the Geto Boys engineer to mix our album and then I met him.&nbsp;A year later he referred me to be the in-house engineer at Rap-A-Lot.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>You were playing synths beforehand?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah, I’ve been playing synths since I was fourteen.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Was it a big jump going from that style of music to how the Geto Boys were working?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah, it was more sample-based when I first started. The first thing I ever played was keyboards and guitar for Big Mello. People started hearing around town that at the label I played instruments and shit. They started hiring me to take away the sample or else to build on the sample, you know. That’s kind of where my career started in producing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>I know that the Geto Boys are often credited with spearheading&nbsp;the Horrorcore movement in hip-hop to an extent. What was your reaction to hearing lyrics like that?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Oh, I thought it&nbsp;was great. It was kind of entertaining, funny. The first&nbsp;album I worked on&nbsp;for&nbsp;Rap A Lot&nbsp;was Bushwick Bill, the horrorcore king.&nbsp;Ganksta N-I-P was writing a lot of that stuff. He was a good friend, he still is. He's a crazy rapper.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>You also connected with Scarface and became a pretty trusted collaborator of his, contributing to a lot of classic albums. What about his artistry and lyricism really connected with you?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">I mean his lyrics were immaculate. He always had something good to say and still does. He still does, I just talked to him the other day. He&nbsp;inspired me a lot cause he was like a producer. He played the keys and guitar. All his uncles and shit played so he grew up playing instruments. We’d push each other making beats because he’d play the guitar, then I’d try, and vice versa.</p><h2><strong>"[Scarface]&nbsp;always had something good to say and still does.

I’d be on the keyboard, he’d be on guitar, bass. We'd take turns on the drum machine.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>That's cool. Scarface producing -- I didn't know that.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He’s really good.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>I wanted to ask about Scarface's&nbsp;The Fix specifically.&nbsp;What was your experience like working on that one and later seeing the response? It got five mics in The Source when it dropped. Was that a meaningful project for you?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yeah, definitely. I’ve got a few albums with five mics, it's kind of cool. [Laughs] That album was whenever Scarface was president of Def Jam South. He spent a lot of time in New York running the label. That’s when he started working with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a> more. That's where he met Kanye West -- that’s where Kanye actually learned about me. He heard “Guess Who’s Back” and was like “who mixed that?" Then he sent his people out to find me. That’s when I started mixing for him.</p><p><h6><strong>Marc Piasecki/Getty Images.

That was a great era though I really looked back on the late 90s, early 2000s as being kind of a special time. At least for me.

I was doing that stream and I had a million views on the stream. I was tripping. I made two hours of music that sounded like finished music, it was great.

You know we all worked together in my era. Daz and Kurupt used to stay in my apartment a lot. Nate Dogg would pull up all the time and do vocals. Family affairs, it was dope.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>The way that they moved&nbsp;in the studio, how was it different from the Geto Boys? Were there any similarities or differences in the process?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">They were a lot faster writers, you know. I think the Geto Boys really thought about what they were writing. Those guys kinda just plowed across shit. I actually gotta get going, my session is about to get started.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Cool.
