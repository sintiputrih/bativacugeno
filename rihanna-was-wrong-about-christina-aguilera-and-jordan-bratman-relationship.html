Less than two years after Rihanna gushed over the adorable couple, they have announced their split. Despite looking lovey-dovey on the press, the singer revealed they were miserable during their marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar49176952.jpg><p>"You could definitely tell we were unhappy," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aguilera shared to </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "When you're unhappy in a marriage, your children are the ones who suffer.

Although the couple tried to make it work for their kid, their marriage ultimately ended for their child's sake.</p><p>Aguilera opened up and said, "Things were so unhealthy and unhappy for both Jordan and me, I knew I had to end it. It wasn’t good for us, and it wasn’t good for Max to witness our arguments. Children can feel when things aren’t right in the home. I had bouts of extreme anxiety. I really didn’t want to hurt Jordan, and I felt torn about splitting our family up."</p><h2 id=what-went-wrong-with-christina-aguilera-and-jordan-bratman-39-s-marriage>What Went Wrong With Christina Aguilera And Jordan Bratman's Marriage</h2><p>One of the factor that might have contributed greatly to the marriage's demise was the fact that they were too young when they got together. Aguilera was only 21-years-old when she met Bratman, and not much older than that when they tied the knot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"At the time, it felt absolutely right," Aguilera said in the previously mentioned interview with People. "Jordan and I were best friends first, and then it grew to be more. He represented stability and love and safety-qualities I never got from a male figure growing up. I felt we could share the rest of our lives together. I wanted to marry someone who would be a good father. And he is."</p><p>The singer continued, "We were great the first year after Max was born. Jordan was amazing. He was the first to change Max’s diaper. Then things turned. I was nurturing Max and felt independent in that relationship. Then I went right into filming Burlesque [in fall 2009]. As a musician, you’re with your posse all the time, and during the movie I removed myself from mine. So I had an independence I’d never felt before. I was growing leaps and bounds daily. I went from being a girl to a woman."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar49192628.jpg><p>"We were both looking for different things. We just weren’t right for each other. I couldn’t face living another five years [together] and feeling that I wasted [that time] being unhappy."</p><p>Aguilera has since moved on to create a life with Matthew Rutler. They have one child together named Summer, and Aguilera works hard to have a peacefully blended family.</p><p>Rutler and Aguilera have been engaged since 2014, but the couple seems to have no plans to actually walk down the aisle. They are enjoying their lives exactly as they are and do not need to make their relationship legally official.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoqCRo7uiedaaqmavoqS7qHnAm6aurF2YtbO10q2gp5ldlrS2tcueqZplkaOxbrbOq5uapl2Xv6LAzJqlZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frihanna-was-wrong-about-christina-aguilera-and-jordan-bratman-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frihanna-was-wrong-about-christina-aguilera-and-jordan-bratman-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frihanna-was-wrong-about-christina-aguilera-and-jordan-bratman-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frihanna-was-wrong-about-christina-aguilera-and-jordan-bratman-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frihanna-was-wrong-about-christina-aguilera-and-jordan-bratman-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frihanna-was-wrong-about-christina-aguilera-and-jordan-bratman-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./synology-ds211-smb-nas-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./synology-ds211-smb-nas-review.html>SMB Performance - Synology DS211+ SMB NAS Review</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nevina-shtylla-html.html>Nevina Shtylla - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nevina-shtylla-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
