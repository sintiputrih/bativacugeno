He made his career debut in the season opener against San Diego State and brought in his first career reception for five yards during the victory.</p><p>In week 3, he posted his first multi-reception game (two catches for 29 yards) of his career against Michigan State, with both catches traveling for 10-plus yards and resulting in first downs against the Spartans. The following week, he hauled in three passes for 32 yards, with a long of 19, while also recording the first touchdown catch of his career in the Irish’ 38-21 win over Purdue.</p><p>In week 5, he registered season-highs in receptions (5) and receiving yards (70) and added his second and final touchdown of the season versus Stanford. He hauled in two catches for 26 yards against Pittsburgh, setting a new school record for receptions by a freshmen tight end in a single season during the game.</p><p>In week 11, he established a school record for single-season receiving yards by a freshman tight end during the game against Syracuse. In the 2008 Hawaii Bowl game, he caught four passes for a season-high 78 yards. His 29-yard reception against the Warriors also set a season-best long reception. Rudolph finished his first year with the Irish with 29 receptions for 340 yards (11.7 avg.) and two touchdowns.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=sophomore-season-2009></span>Sophomore season (2009)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As a sophomore in 2009, Rudolph participated in only ten games with nine starts, missing three due to a shoulder injury and totaling 275:59 of playing time while making 57 special-teams appearances. He was named semi-finalist for the John Mackey Award (presented annually to college football’s most outstanding tight end) and was the only sophomore to be named semi-finalist. He hauled in four catches for 29 yards and a touchdown in the opener against Nevada.</p><p>In week 3, he set a then career-high with 95 receiving yards against Michigan State including a season-long 52-yard reception. His performance against the Spartans earned him John Mackey Tight End of the Week honors. He nabbed touchdown catches in back-to-back weeks against Purdue and Washington, with the first coming against the Boilermakers when there were only 24 seconds remaining in the game on a fourth-and-goal situation that sealed Notre Dame’s win; the second touchdown reception against Washington came with less than two minutes remaining in regulation and gave the Irish the lead.</p><p>He was voted by his teammates to represent tight ends on the Irish Leadership Committee. Rudolph ended the season ranked third on the team with 33 receptions (17 resulting in first downs) for 364 yards and three touchdowns.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=junior-season-2010></span>Junior season (2010)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Rudolph had his promising 2010 junior season derailed by a hamstring injury that ended his season after six games. On September 11, he set a Notre Dame record for most receiving yards in a game by a tight end against Michigan with 164 yards on eight receptions, with more than half of the yardage coming after he hauled in the second-longest pass play in school history with a 95-yard touchdown.</p><p>He finished his final collegiate season with 28 receptions for 328 yards and three touchdowns, ending his three-season career at Notre Dame ranked among the all-time leading tight ends in school history. His 90 career receptions were the fourth-most by a tight end in school history and his 1,032 career receiving yards are also fourth-most.</p><p>His pair of eight-catch games fell one reception short of the school record for a tight end of nine receptions in a game and was only the fourth Irish tight end to break the 1,000-yard career yardage plateau. On January 4, 2011, he decided to forgo his senior season and declared for the 2011 NFL Draft.</p><p>He did not participate in the 2011 NFL combine because of his torn hamstring but posted a 4.78 40-yard dash time only three weeks after being medically cleared to participate at Notre Dame’s Pro Day in South Bend, Indiana. He was selected by the Minnesota Vikings with the 43rd overall pick in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft.</p><p>He was the first tight end selected in the draft and is the second-highest drafted a tight end in Vikings history behind Hal Bedsole (chosen in the first round, 19th overall) in the 1964 NFL Draft.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kyle-rudolph-professional-career></span><span>Kyle Rudolph Professional career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2015-season></span>2015 season<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2015, Rudolph started all 16 games for the second time in his career. He posted a career-high 495 yards receiving and had the second-best totals of his career in receptions with 49 and touchdowns with five. Due to a weak Vikings’ offensive line, Rudolph was asked to block often and helped clear the way for Adrian Peterson to lead the NFL in rushing with 1,485 yards on the ground. In Week 2 against the Detroit Lions, he caught 5 passes for 30 yards and a touchdown.</p><p>He set a single-game career high with 106 yards receiving against the Green Bay Packers on November 22, including a career-long 47-yard touchdown. The following week, he caught a season-high seven passes in the win against the Atlanta Falcons. In the Wild Card Playoff loss against the Seattle Seahawks, he moved the chains with a 24-yard reception late in the fourth quarter that led to the infamous Blair Walsh’ missed the field goal.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2016-season></span>2016 season<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In the third preseason game at the U.S. Bank Stadium, Rudolph hauled in a 27-yard touchdown pass from Teddy Bridgewater late in the second quarter. Rudolph’s reception was Minnesota’s first touchdown in its new stadium. In Week 2 of the regular season, Rudolph caught a touchdown pass in the end zone, (the first for Sam Bradford as a Viking) in the 17-14 win over the Green Bay Packers.</p><p>In the Vikings’ upset of the 2015 NFC champions Carolina Panthers in Week 3, Rudolph was one of the few bright spots for a Vikings’ offense that struggled to move the ball in the first half, catching 7 passes for 70 yards and a touchdown.</p><p>Against the New York Giants on October 3, Rudolph hauled in five receptions (four of them resulting in first downs) for 55 yards and a touchdown. In Week 13 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Rudolph hauled in his sixth touchdown of the season and 28th of his career, placing him in a tie with Vikings legend Steve Jordan for the most by a tight end in franchise history.</p><p>In Week 17 against the Chicago Bears, Rudolph saw 15 passes thrown his way, hauling in 11 for 117 yards (including a touchdown) to set the franchise record for most receptions in a season for a tight end with 83. Overall, in the 2016 season, he finished with 83 receptions for 840 yards and seven touchdowns.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2017-season></span>2017 season<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2017, he started all 16 games, recording 57 catches for 532 yards and eight touchdowns. The Vikings finished with a 13-3 record atop the NFC North and made it to the NFC Championship. He had a 25-yard touchdown reception on the first drive of the game, which proved to be the Vikings only score as they went on to lose 38-7 to the Philadelphia Eagles. On January 22, 2018, he was named to his second Pro Bowl.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2018-season></span>2018 season<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In Week 1 of the 2018 season, Rudolph scored a touchdown, his first with new quarterback Kirk Cousins, in the victory over the San Francisco 49ers. In Week 16, against the Detroit Lions, he caught a Hail Mary for a touchdown before the end of the half. On the day, he had nine receptions for 122 yards and two touchdowns in the 27–9 victory. Overall in 2018 he had 64 receptions for 634 yards and scored 4 Touchdowns.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2019-season></span>2019 season<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On June 10, 2019, the Vikings signed Rudolph to a four-year, $36 million contract extension. This came after Rudolph was involved in trade rumors throughout the offseason, but with the new deal, it keeps him under contract through the 2023 season.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kyle-rudolph-twitter></span><span>Kyle Rudolph Twitter</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by KyleRudolph82</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kyle-rudolph-instagram></span><span>Kyle Rudolph Instagram</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1foMatsYyrrJ2nnKW1bq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6txp5kp52kYsSwvtOhZJ%2Bnn6mvorjLZquin5ipeqa6w2adqKpdqbWmecyipaedo6TBonnVoqKippeoerG%2Bzp%2BcrKuZpLuiuIycmKudlad8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkyle-rudolph-biography-age-net-worth-football-tight-end-for-the-minnesota-vikings-professional-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkyle-rudolph-biography-age-net-worth-football-tight-end-for-the-minnesota-vikings-professional-career.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkyle-rudolph-biography-age-net-worth-football-tight-end-for-the-minnesota-vikings-professional-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkyle-rudolph-biography-age-net-worth-football-tight-end-for-the-minnesota-vikings-professional-career.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkyle-rudolph-biography-age-net-worth-football-tight-end-for-the-minnesota-vikings-professional-career.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkyle-rudolph-biography-age-net-worth-football-tight-end-for-the-minnesota-vikings-professional-career.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./phil-mattingly-biography-age-height-net-worth-birthday-wife-journalist-wikipedia.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./phil-mattingly-biography-age-height-net-worth-birthday-wife-journalist-wikipedia.html>Phil Mattingly Biography: Age, Height, Net Worth, Birthday, Wife, Journalist, Wikipedia,</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kelsey-asbille.html>Kelsey Asbille Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kelsey-asbille.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
