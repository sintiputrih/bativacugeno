Yes, her supportive husband of over 9 years with whom she also shares a daughter is her everything.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Let’s discuss more </span><span style=font-weight:400>as this article proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Leila Farzad Husband: Is The Actress Married?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, Leila Farzad is married to her husband James. The pair tied the knot back in October 2013, and it was indeed a day to remember for the lovebirds — who were already friends for over 6 years then.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For the wedding, Leila wore a white dress while her husband rocked a grey suit. Amidst their family and friends, the two then exchanged vows and walked through the lawn making their way to an amazing honeymoon trip.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Today, the two have been married for over 9 years, and still, the fire in their eyes remains the same. Infact, Leila has fallen even more in love with James. She even went as far as to call him a “legend” who made their daughter banana oat pancakes.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On Sundays, the two often go out to a Persian restaurant where they gather with friends and family and eat heaps of buttery rice with bread, stew, and chicken. “We then waddle out with takeaway boxes as we’ve over-ordered,” Leila added.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So far, the most memorable Sunday for the actress was the Baftas in 2021. At the time, she was nominated for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>I Hate Suzie</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and they did it via video link. “They sent round hair and makeup people, who put glitter on my daughter’s cheeks as well. I sat on the sofa, dressed up to the nines with crazy jewelry on. Mum was there, too. She wasn’t thrilled about me becoming an actor rather than a lawyer, but that night, she was OK with it,” she recalled.</span></p><h3><b>Leila Farzad On Better</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Leila Farzad plays DI Lou Slack on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Better</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. According to BBC, her character and Col McHugh (Andrew Buchan) “explores the complex and powerful bonds of loyalty and family” and “the power of human conscience.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, talking in detail, Lou first meets Col when she was struggling as a young police officer, and Col was a newcomer to the Leeds underworld. They then deal make a deal (not explained to avoid spoilers) that shapes their lives — allowing Lou to rise in her career and Col to become rich and powerful.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sadly, years later, Lou’s family is “brought to the brink of a tragedy” and she must finally correct what she has done, which ultimately includes trying to bring down Col.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, Lou makes her first move against Col and explains to him that her colleagues got an “anonymous tip” about an associate named Noel, a person she was unable to “kill” completely. “Best I could do was to get ahead of it and make sure that Noel didn’t get himself shot, then I reminded him that you would be there for him,” she says.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unimpressed, Col then replies, “You come to me wanting to take him, and I say no, and then the very same night I find out that you’ve nicked him at a safe house that only you and five other people know about?”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>BBC One </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Better</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was set to hit the small screen in 2023. Excited for the premiere, Leila said, “[</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Better</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> is] a brilliant fresh take on the morality tale. I am excited to have the opportunity to play Lou Slack, the vehicle through which we explore the multivalent layers of good and bad.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, joining the actress for its inaugural season are Samuel Edward-Cook, Zak Ford-Williams, Ceallach Spellman, Carolin Stoltz, Anton Lesser, and Olivia Nakintu.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Leila Farzad Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Leila Farzad flaunted a net worth of over $300 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This actress started her career back in 2006, but as a voice actor for Mummy Cat in Peppa Pig. Three years later, she then landed a&nbsp; role in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Law & Order: UK</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>&nbsp;and the years following were filled with bliss. So far, she’s already graced over 15 movies and TV shows including </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Avenue 5 </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>(2022), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Fear Index</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2022), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Landscapes </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>(2021),</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Innocent </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>(2018), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Man Down </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>(2015), and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Married Single Other (</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>2011).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2022, she was represented by the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>B-side management</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her talents also include singling ability, and multiple accents (RPNeutral, Middle Eastern (Arabic), London (Cockney), Northern (Leeds), European (Spanish), European (French), and American).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But that’s not all, Leila also has a degree in French and Italian literature from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Oxford</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and an acting degree from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Guildhall School of Music & Drama</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span style=font-weight:400> Leila was nominated for BAFTA for her role in I Hate Suzie.</span></p><h3><b>Leila Farzad Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Leila Farzad was 38 years of age in 2022.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Leila Farzad Parents?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Leila Farzad’s parents are from Iran. Though she didn’t reveal their names, she confessed that her mother wanted her to be a doctor, lawyer, or accountant.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But at the age of 17, Leila said no to her mom. Obviously, her mother disapproved of her decision! However, she assured her that if she got a degree from Oxford or Cambridge, she’ll think about it! And so she did!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, Leila’s an actress.</span></p><h3><b>Leila Farzad Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Leila Farzad stands tall at a height of 5 feet 6 inches (167 cm).</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Is Leila Farzad On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>leila_farzad_official</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, here’s her Twitter @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Leila_Farzad</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>leila.farzad.5</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>When Is Leila Farzad Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Leil receives her birthday wishes on December 30 and is of the Capricorn zodiac.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Leila Farzad From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Leila was born in London, United Kingdom.
