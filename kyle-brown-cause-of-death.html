Kyle died suddenly at just 42 years old while he was at the super regional in Winston-Salem, N.C. The game between Alabama and Wake Forest was delayed two hours as a result of the emergency.</p><p>Now, following the disruption of the game and the news that Kyle died, many viewers want to know more details about the event, including what his cause of death was. Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Kyle Brown's cause of death?</h2><p>In a statement released on June 11, 2023, ESPN officially announced <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle's death</a>.</p><p>“A 16-year ESPN employee, Kyle was a deeply admired member of our production team — and highly accomplished, having captured two <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports</a> Emmy Awards while working a multitude of sports from baseball and basketball to Monday Night Football and college football,” the statement said, suggesting that Kyle accumulated plenty of experience during his time in the league.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ESPN</span></figure><p>No official announcement has been made with regard to Kyle's cause of death, which means that those who are curious can only speculate about what happened to him. Kyle's death was apparently the result of a "medical emergency," although what that means exactly remains unclear. It seems to have been a fairly sudden event, and one that required emergency attention once it started.</p><p>Kyle was also a former pitcher at Ohio State University.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kyle's family is also in mourning.</h2><p>In addition to his colleagues at ESPN, Kyle also left a young family behind with his sudden death. He is survived by his wife, Megan, and their four children — Makayla, 14, Carson, 11, Camden, 9, and Madyn, 6.</p><p>Kyle received a tribute on the air on June 11 before ESPN started covering the super regionals once again. In the tribute, anchor Kris Budden announced Kyle's passing to everyone watching.</p><p>“Kyle cherished the opportunities to have a career in sports," Kris said. “His ESPN family wishes to extend our deepest condolences and full support to Kyle’s loved ones … Kyle will be greatly missed.”</p><p>Because Kyle wasn't a public figure, it's unclear how much more information we may get about his death. Those who want to know the cause may be left in the dark indefinitely. Releasing such details will be up to Kyle's family, which may or may not happen.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>NCAA Baseball coverage across ESPN, ESPN2 & ESPNU began at noon today with this tribute to Kyle Brown from <a href=#>@KrisBudden</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/l4B7uuXcJT</a></p>— ESPN PR (@ESPNPR) <a href=#>June 11, 2023</a></figure><p>Events like Kyle's death, in which someone dies in the midst of coverage, aren't all that common. That's part of the reason that there was such interest in the immediate aftermath of Kyle's collapse, and why so many people were curious about what the medical emergency he suffered from might have been.</p><p>Whatever happened to Kyle, it seems clear that both his family and colleagues were totally shocked by his sudden death. Now, as his family mourns his loss, the public should work to respect their privacy, understanding that they're working through what their life will look like now without Kyle.</p><p>Our thoughts and prayers are with Kyle's family, friends, and colleagues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoMatsYybqaivnmKwosHSnmSonl2ZsqLAxw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkyle-brown-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkyle-brown-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkyle-brown-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkyle-brown-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkyle-brown-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkyle-brown-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-money-does-james-gregory-keelor-make-latest-james-gregory-keelor-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-money-does-james-gregory-keelor-make-latest-james-gregory-keelor-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>How Much Money Does James Gregory Keelor Make?
