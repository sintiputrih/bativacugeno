<time>20 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Examine the most recent information on Eve Gilles’ passing and learn the contentious and shocking facts about Miss France 2023.</strong></p><p>Eve Gilles, 20, was crowned Miss Nord-Pas-de-Calais 2023 and is now the subject of a dispute that was sparked by false reports on social media about her tragic death.</p><p>The popular beauty queen, who is well-known for having short hair, is getting ready to compete in Dijon on December 16 for the title of Miss France 2024.</p><p>Despite her successes, Gilles is criticized by those who call her “androgynous” and “woke.”</p><p>Critics point out a conflict between Gilles’ distinctive, contemporary style and conventional beauty standards by criticizing her unusual features.</p><p>As the dispute develops, it calls into question how beauty pageants interface with society’s standards and what obstacles people who want to achieve their goals despite conventional wisdom must overcome.</p><p>Gilles’ path is unexpectedly complicated by the issue as she competes for the Miss France crown in front of both praise and criticism.</p><h2>Why Is Eve Gilles’s Death News Trending in Miss France 2023?</h2><p>Shortly after Eve Gilles was named Miss Nord-Pas-de-Calais on October 14 at the Arena indoor stadium in Liévin, the death fake began to circulate on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>While some users stated she had committed herself in response to the criticism she got for her looks, others reported she had perished in an automobile accident.</p><p>Some even shared obituary and funeral photographs that had been Photoshopped. All of these assertions, however, are untrue and unfounded.</p><p>Eve Gilles is unharmed and has not been a part of any mishap or disaster.</p><p>In addition, she has not addressed the death rumors. Instead, she has kept up her Instagram feed with encouraging words and pictures of herself getting ready for the Miss France competition.</p><p>Although the genesis of the death hoax is unknown, it could have something to do with Eve’s experiences receiving negative comments and threats on the internet after she won the regional championship.</p><p>She has been criticized by some for being too political, too feminist, or too macho for a beauty queen.</p><p>Additionally, many have questioned the judge’s selection of her over individuals with more conventional looks.</p><h2>Eve Gilles’s Scandal and Divorce</h2><p>Eve Gilles is not Miss Nord-Pas-de-Calais’s first controversial figure.</p><p>In the last 10 years, the area has produced four Miss France winners: Indira Ampiot (2023), Maëva Coucke (2018), Camille Cerf (2015), and Iris Mittenaere (2016).</p><p>Due to a variety of factors, including their background, looks, or beliefs, each of them has experienced hostility or criticism.</p><p>Originally from Quaëdypre, Eve Gilles’ mother is from Reunion. She has expressed her desire to “break the codes” and “bring something new” to the Miss France competition.</p><p>She has also said that she felt stronger and more secure after deciding to chop her hair short on a whim.</p><p>In addition, she studies computer science and mathematics to become a statistician. But not everyone appreciates her variety and originality.</p><p>She has been referred to be “lesbian,” “boyish,” and “ugly” by others. She has also been called “woke” or “leftist” by others, suggesting that she is attempting to utilize her appearance to further her political views.</p><p>Because she does not conform to the traditional picture of a French lady, some have even stated that she should not represent France.</p><p>But Eve hasn’t let the haters win. Fans, celebrities, and past Miss France winners have all supported her and complimented her on her knowledge, charm, and attractiveness.</p><p>Additionally, she has expressed her pride in who she is and her desire to encourage other young ladies to be themselves.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Miss France 2023</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Linda Anne Stamaton | Husband And Married Life</a></h3>Sports analyst Al Michaels' spouse is Linda Anne Stamaton.
