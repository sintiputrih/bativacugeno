For fans of the Boston Red Sox, spring training is an opportunity to see their favorite players up close and witness the team's preparation for the upcoming season. But where exactly does the Red Sox hold their spring training? In this article, we will explore the location of Red Sox spring training and delve into the history and significance of this annual tradition.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Boston Red Sox, one of the oldest and most storied franchises in Major League Baseball (MLB), have been conducting their spring training since the early 20th century. Over the years, the location of their spring training has changed multiple times, reflecting the team's desire to find the perfect setting to prepare for the grueling season ahead.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Initially, the Red Sox held their spring training in various locations across the United States, often moving from state to state in search of favorable weather conditions. One of the earliest spring training sites for the Red Sox was Hot Springs, Arkansas, where they trained from 1901 to 1918. However, as travel became more convenient, the team decided to explore new locations.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>In the 1950s, the Red Sox made an important move by establishing their spring training headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona. The team trained at Scottsdale Stadium, which provided excellent facilities and a warm climate conducive to player development. This move to Arizona marked the beginning of a long-standing relationship between the Red Sox and the state.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Since 2012, the Boston Red Sox have called JetBlue Park in Fort Myers, Florida, their spring training home. This state-of-the-art facility has become a hub for Red Sox fans, providing them with an opportunity to witness their favorite players in action during the preseason.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>JetBlue Park, often referred to as "Fenway South," is a replica of Fenway Park, the iconic home stadium of the Red Sox in Boston. The replica design includes the "Green Monster," a 37-foot-tall wall in left field, which is one of the most distinctive features of Fenway Park. The park also features other unique elements, such as a manual scoreboard and the famous red seat, commemorating the longest home run ever hit at Fenway Park.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The facilities at JetBlue Park are top-notch and include multiple practice fields, batting cages, and a modern clubhouse. The Red Sox players have everything they need to fine-tune their skills and prepare for the challenges of the upcoming season. The park also offers an immersive fan experience, with seating capacity for over 11,000 spectators, allowing fans to get up close and personal with their favorite players.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The choice of Fort Myers as the spring training location holds historical significance for the Red Sox. Fort Myers was the winter home of the Red Sox's legendary player, Ted Williams, who spent time in the area during his career. This connection to a baseball legend adds an extra layer of importance to the city as the Red Sox's spring training destination.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Boston Red Sox's spring training location has evolved over time, from Hot Springs, Arkansas, to Scottsdale, Arizona, and finally to JetBlue Park in Fort Myers, Florida. This move to Fort Myers has provided the team with state-of-the-art facilities and a fan-friendly environment. Red Sox fans can now witness their favorite players and enjoy a unique experience reminiscent of Fenway Park. As the team continues to prepare for the upcoming season at JetBlue Park, the tradition of Red Sox spring training remains an integral part of the team's history and legacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn56qlWK2tHnRnptmq5%2BterS80aKloGWkp66qusinnmakn5iutbHD</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-is-red-sox-spring-training-located.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhere-is-red-sox-spring-training-located.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhere-is-red-sox-spring-training-located.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhere-is-red-sox-spring-training-located.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-is-red-sox-spring-training-located.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-is-red-sox-spring-training-located.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./baby-reindeer-richard-gadd-stalking-claims-lawsuit-martha.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./baby-reindeer-richard-gadd-stalking-claims-lawsuit-martha.html>Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd told production company truth about stalker Martha</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lyrics-benson-boone-better-alone.html>LYRICS: Benson Boone Better Alone</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lyrics-benson-boone-better-alone.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
