While the Georgia-born actor has been a star ever since she was a little kid and <a href=#>beat out her sister for a role on Friends</a>, Dakota has simultaneously remained elusive. She gives fans precisely what she wants to and that's it. Instead, she has fans focus on her creative pursuits while <a href=#>she rakes in the dough</a> from her numerous box office successes. However, we do know that she has been romantically linked with a few men.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among Dakota's boyfriends is a man named Henry Frye. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Very little is known about the guy</a>, but the War of the Worlds and Twilight star has been linked to him since 2017. While some reports claim the two are still together, fans think they may have recently broken up. Here's the truth about Dakota Fanning's love life and what's really going on with Henry Frye.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-the-heck-is-henry-frye>Who The Heck Is Henry Frye?</h2><p>We don't know... That's the truth. The man has one credit on IMDb, but it's for a documentary where he plays himself. So, he's not an actor. Even though <a href=#>Dakota has been linked to actor Freddie Highmore</a>, she doesn't appear to be the type who is attracted to other celebrities. But, so far, no publication has figured out who the exceedingly tall and handsome man is. But we know that he studied at the University of Vermont and is a whopping 6 foot 6inches tall. We also know that it was Dakota who initially told the world about their romance in October 2017 when she posted a photo of the two of them licking each other with the caption, "Lovers".</p><p>Not long after that, the two were photographed getting very handy while courtside at a Knicks Game, something that they'd do over and over again. So, we know Henry is a basketball fan... Or, at least, he is when he has a gorgeous and talented blonde sitting next to him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Page Six, Henry and Dakota have also met each other's parents on multiple occasions and Dakota's famous sister Elle has also been spotted hanging with Henry. Dakota also took Henry to numerous red carpet and fashion events, making it clear that she was taken and that she was proud to be with Henry. She also made it known to her Instagram fans that Henry was in the picture.</p><p>In 2018, Dakota would occasionally post photos of the two of them together on her Instagram. Later the photos became a little bit less obvious, such as one of her on a beach with Henry's leg sticking out the side. But as time went on, Henry was featured less and less on Dakota's Instagram. And this has caused fans to question the status of their relationship in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Dakota Fanning Actually Friends With Kristen Stewart?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-39-s-up-with-dakota-and-henry-today>What's Up With Dakota And Henry Today?</h2><p>Henry and Dakota still follow each other on Instagram. His page is private, so it's not easy to decipher what he's been up to since their last post together in 2018. Dakota, on the other hand, hasn't featured Henry on her page for years. In fact, she mostly posts photos of herself, press for her work, and photos of her sister and friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans learned a lot about various celebrities during the beginning of the 2020 pandemic due to everyone being stuck at home. Who these celebrities were stuck at home with exposed a lot. While some celebrities, such as Euphoria's Sydney Sweeney, tried and failed to hide the fact that they were quarantining with a secret partner, Dakota appears to have been only with her family and friends. Not once were fans tipped off that she was with anyone romantically, let alone Henry Frye.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Furious About Sydney Sweeney's Boyfriend, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>So, while some publications are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming that Dakota and Henry are still going strong</a> to this date, they'd have to be doing so in secret. But given Dakota's willingness to show off Henry before 2018, it would be odd that she would suddenly decide to hide him from the world.</p><p>Anyone who was placing bets on the status of Dakota and Henry's relationship would be smart to think that they are no longer together. While they may not have ended on bad terms (hence the Instagram following), it really doesn't appear as though Dakota is with anyone right now. But this won't likely last forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dakota Fanning Shares TB Photo As A Young 'Professional' Tennis Player</a></span></p><p>In past interviews, Dakota has stated just how much she values marriage and her desire to one day have children. In an interview with Glamour, Dakota said: "I have a weird vision of relationships because my parents have known each other since second grade, and they got married right out of college. I've always thought that's what it's supposed to be like, and if it's not, then I don't want to waste my time on it. Even when I was 14, I was like, 'I'm not gonna marry this person. What's the point of doing it?' It's not me being naive. I just know what it's supposed to be like. And I think until I feel that, I cannot be bothered."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Dakota And Elle Fanning’s Mom, Heather Joy Arrington</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmnJGgvLWtjJ%2BYp6aZo7Rurc2dZKGdomKyuXnBqLCfqpmau6V5x56lq7Fdm7%2B6eY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-dakota-fanning-and-her-ex-boyfriend-henry-fry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-between-dakota-fanning-and-her-ex-boyfriend-henry-fry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-dakota-fanning-and-her-ex-boyfriend-henry-fry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-between-dakota-fanning-and-her-ex-boyfriend-henry-fry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-dakota-fanning-and-her-ex-boyfriend-henry-fry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-dakota-fanning-and-her-ex-boyfriend-henry-fry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-ocean-is-west-to-north-america.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-ocean-is-west-to-north-america.html>What ocean is west to North America?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ronnie-coleman-top-5-career-bodybuilding-moments.html>Ronnie Coleman: Top 5 Career Bodybuilding Moments</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ronnie-coleman-top-5-career-bodybuilding-moments.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
