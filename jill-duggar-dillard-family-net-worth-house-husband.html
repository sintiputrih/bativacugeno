Later, they got into a romantic relationship and didn't lag in displaying their love life in public.</span></p><p><span>After a few years of dating, Jill and Derrick shared their wedding vows on 21 June 2014 in a massive ceremony, including thousand guests in&nbsp;Springdale, Arkansas.</span></p><p><span>Also, the wedding ceremony aired on the Duggar family's show '19 Kids and Counting.'</span></p><p><span><strong><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/jill-duggar-derrick-dillard-married.jpg alt width=450 height=388 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></strong></span></p><p><span><strong>Jill Duggar with her husband, Derrick Dillard during their marriage (©: Instagram/Jill Duggar)</strong></span></p><p><span>Currently, Jill and Derrick are in a romantic excursion for five years, which they relish along with their two children, Israel and Samuel.</span></p><h2><span><strong>She&nbsp;Can Appear In The Family Show Only&nbsp;If Her Husband&nbsp;Approves Her</strong></span></h2><p><span>Derrick Duggar, Jill Duggar Dillard's husband, has a new condition for her to work. He has come with a term of 'work within reasons,' as of the recent update.</span></p><p><span>Jill's parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, who are&nbsp;also guardians of 19 kids, have a strict rule. They do not want their daughters&nbsp;to wear skirts,&nbsp;touch, kiss, or hold hands to their future husbands until their wedding day.</span></p><p><span>In the case of Jill Duggar Dillard, she does want to break free from her family as she appears to have different aspirations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, Derrick made an alarming comment on her work, citing that she can do whatever job she wants to within reason. Many of Jill's fans wanted to know what actually 'within reason' means. But it seems that Derrick wants Jill to break from the Duggar family under his aspirations. He wants her to work according to him.</span></p><p><span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/photos/jill-duggar-dillard-derrick-duggar.jpg alt width=650 height=646 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span><strong>Jill Duggar Dillard and her husband Derrick Duggar (©: Instagram/Jill Duggar)</strong></span></p><p><span>It might be true, as well as Derrick Duggar's previous comments about Duggar Family supports the fact much enough. Previously, Jill's husband mentioned that it's tough to&nbsp;see Jill's family because she needs permission from her father, Jim Bob,&nbsp;to go to the large family home. Moreover, he stated that he and Jill were compelled to work when they did not want as TLC pressured him and Jill.</span></p><p><span>It's a prominent example of why Derrick Duggar created a condition of 'within reason' to pursue work for Jill Duggar Dillard.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46joKWkXZnCqLPAq2SdoZyhrrOwjJ%2BYpqGcrnqvsdNmrqiqpJ16qbvUrJxmoKWor6K6ww%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjill-duggar-dillard-family-net-worth-house-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjill-duggar-dillard-family-net-worth-house-husband.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjill-duggar-dillard-family-net-worth-house-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjill-duggar-dillard-family-net-worth-house-husband.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjill-duggar-dillard-family-net-worth-house-husband.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjill-duggar-dillard-family-net-worth-house-husband.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-logitech-harmony-elite-experience-ultimate-control.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-logitech-harmony-elite-experience-ultimate-control.html>Final Thoughts - The Logitech Harmony Elite Experience: Ultimate Control</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-tour-players-splash-their-cash-on-158848.html>What Tour Players Splash Their Cash On</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-tour-players-splash-their-cash-on-158848.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
