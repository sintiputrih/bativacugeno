‘Cuz I’m blessed by nationality.
I’m member of a growing populace,
We enforce our popularity.
There are things that seem to pull us under and,
There are things that drag us down.
But there’s a power and a vital presence,
It’s lurking all around.
We’ve got the American Jesus,
See him on the interstate.
We’ve got the American Jesus,
He helped build the President’s estate.</description></item><item><title>Cindy Prado Diet Age - Bio, Wiki, Height, Net Worth, Relationship (2023)</title><link>/cindy-prado-diet.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cindy-prado-diet.html</guid><description>(born 20 January 1992; age: 29) Cindy Prado is a well-known American model, influencer, social media star, actor, and Internet sensation.
