On September 11, 2001, the day of the attack that left 658 of his company’s employees dead, his two boys, Brandon and Kyle, began preschool and kindergarten respectively. He had to drop his son off at kindergarten, therefore he was late for work that day.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Howard_Lutnick_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Howard Lutnick?

He is 76 kg in weight and 1.76 meters tall.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Howard_Lutnick_start_his_Professional_Career>How did Howard Lutnick start his Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Soon after receiving his college diploma in 1983, Howard Lutnick started working for Cantor Fitzgerald. He grew close to Bernard Cantor, the company’s founder, who also acted as his mentor when he was employed there.</p><p>In 1991, he was named the company’s CEO, president, and chairman. When he made the eSpeed public, Lutnick made a significant choice. eSpeed was a Cantor Fitzgerald subsidiary at the time.</p><p>This is what allowed the business to exist after the attack killed over three-quarters of its brokers. It was fortunate that eSpeed, an electronic trading subsidiary, did not mandate that brokers trade publicly.</p><p>Lutnick became leader of the London Office once the corporation was divided into two distinct companies, each with its own set of operations. Cantor continues to oversee both major stock deals and bond trading departments. The newly established business, BGC, would partake in broker-driven trading. Because the two businesses were independent, Cantor was forced to take out a $400 million loan to support the expansion of the newly formed business. 2008 witnessed the $1.3 billion merger of BGC Partners and eSpeed, which Lutnick handled.</p><p>He refused to let this decide his fate. Howard Lutnick put in a lot of effort to become one of the world’s billionaires; he hasn’t let any setbacks get in the way of his success.</p><p>He even lost his brother in an attack at his place of employment, but this motivated him to start helping attack victims. The sky is the limit for him; his net worth is rising daily, and one day he might be much richer than he is now.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Wife, Girlfriend, And Family Of Adam G.
