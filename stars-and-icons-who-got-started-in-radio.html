Yes, there are radio moguls that all are familiar with today like <a href=#>Howard Stern</a>, Terry Gross, and Ira Glass, but many forget that some of the most prominent comedians, musicians, and television stars were once working in the all-audio industry.</p><h2 id=orson-welles><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Orson Welles</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before he was the director of Citizen Kane, one of the most iconic films in Hollywood history, Welles was just a young actor whose budding career was growing in the world of radio. The voice of superheroes like The Shadow and other stories, Welles also became a piece of American history with one of his radio performances. In 1938 on the day before Halloween, Welles narrated an adaptation of H.G. Well's story The War of the Worlds, a story about aliens invading Earth. This caused a national panic that aliens were actually invading, as some listeners who tuned in did not know that the show was a piece of fiction. Welles lost a lot of work in radio thanks to the panic, but the fact his broadcast was so believable speaks to the depths of his talent.</p><h2 id=lucille-ball><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lucille Ball</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before she changed television history with her sitcom I Love Lucy, Lucille Ball <a href=#>could only get work as a supporting player in radio shows</a>, usually with her husband Desi Arnaz. But as Ball got more work, audiences quickly realized how talented and hilarious she was. As television began to dominate the market for entertainment that radio once held, Ball moved to the new format and became one of the most beloved comedic actresses to ever live.</p><h2 id=weird-al><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Weird Al</span></h2><p>Weird Al's life is an amazing one. Not many realize that the parody musician famous for accordion solos and for mocking pop songs is extremely intelligent. He graduated from high school early, starting college when he was only 16. There he began an interest in music, and while he was finding his niche he was working as DJ at his college radio station. When he began recording his parody tracks, his breakout one being "Eat It," a parody of Michael Jackson's "Beat It," novelty music DJ Doctor Demento played Weird Al's tracks regularly, leading Al to the path of stardom he now enjoys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oprah-winfrey><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Oprah Winfrey</span></h2><p>Everyone has heard the sordid details about Oprah's traumatic early life. How she escaped poverty and slowly built the empire she now stands on top of with billions of dollars to her name. But everyone has to start somewhere. Ever wonder how Oprah got her TV show in the first place? Well, she got the show after building a following as a news anchor for Nashville television. How did she get that job? Oprah <a href=#>had previously worked as a newsreader for a radio station when she was only 16</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey Couldn't Wait For This Guest To Leave After He Mentioned His Book '29 Times'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-seacrest><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ryan Seacrest</span></h2><p>The host of American Idol now runs <a href=#>a reality TV empire</a> that has garnered him immense clout in Hollywood and hundreds of millions of dollars. Like Oprah Winfrey, he started to work in radio when he was only 16 years old as a lowly intern. From there, he went on to television hosting, first for children's game shows and then eventually American Idol, which was a cultural sensation that forever locked Seacrest into the world of stardom. He continues to work in radio as the host of his show On Air With Ryan Seacrest.</p><h2 id=carson-daly><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Carson Daly</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daly has hosted several shows, including Today on NBC, and most famous was his role as the Video Jockey on MTV's TRL. <a href=#>Daly's first hosting gig was radio</a>. Before TRL, Daly was a host on 106.7 KROQ-FM, one of the most popular radio stations to air in Los Angeles and most of Southern California.</p><h2 id=ludacris><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ludacris</span></h2><p>The rapper, producer, and star of the Fast and Furious films had humble beginnings in radio before albums like Chicken N Beer went platinum. He began as an intern for the Atlanta radio station Hot 97.5, but eventually rose up to become a DJ and host. He was not going by Ludacris yet though. Luda, whose given name is Christopher Brian Bridges, was DJing under the name Chris Lova Lova before moving on to his successful rap career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ludacris Flips To End Of 'Fast And Furious' Scripts To Make Sure He Doesn't Die</a></span></p><h2 id=david-letterman><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>David Letterman</span></h2><p>Letterman arguably changed the comedy game with his public pranks and the embracing of his awkward demeanor on Late Night and The Late Show. He even used his love of pranks to help comedian Andy Kaufman trick the world into thinking he was feuding with wrestler Jerry Lawler for breaking his neck. Before that and his other iconic moments in television history, Letterman found his voice in college as a news host for his college radio station. He would eventually get fired from that and move on to another radio station. Perhaps his was not a voice meant for serious topics such as the news.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wendy-williams><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Wendy Williams</span></h2><p>Williams might have stepped back from hosting her daytime talk show, but that does not change her track record that built up her career as a pundit, commentator, and host. Williams' career goes back to her college days and Northeastern University in Boston, MA. There she started as DJ for her college station, WRBB, during the 1980s. Her radio work has carried on well throughout her career, despite an intense back and forth it caused with controversial figures, <a href=#>like Bill Cosby</a> for example.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZmiqHqiusNmoJynnqh6uLTOZp6orF2owaK%2B056bZqGeYr%2BisMioZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstars-and-icons-who-got-started-in-radio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstars-and-icons-who-got-started-in-radio.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstars-and-icons-who-got-started-in-radio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstars-and-icons-who-got-started-in-radio.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstars-and-icons-who-got-started-in-radio.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstars-and-icons-who-got-started-in-radio.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-full-cast-of-the-real-housewives-ultimate-girls-trip-rhony-legacy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-full-cast-of-the-real-housewives-ultimate-girls-trip-rhony-legacy.html>The full cast of The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: RHONY Legacy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./maria-fernanda-yepes-biography.html>Mara Fernanda Yepes Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./maria-fernanda-yepes-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
