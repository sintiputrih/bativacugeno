He requested Wienerschnitzel, fried potatoes, and a bottle of white wine for his final meal. He enjoyed it so much that he asked for seconds of all of it.</span><span class=credit>German Federal Archive</span> <span class=caption-body>In most prisons, it is rare for inmates to be allowed alcohol. However, murderer Gary Gilmore was allowed three shots of Jack Daniels whiskey with his hamburger, baked potato, hard-boiled egg, and coffee prior to his execution in 1977.</span><span class=credit>Pixabay</span> <span class=caption-body>Known as the Killer Clown for his work as a performer at fundraising events and parades, John Wayne Gacy assaulted, tortured, and murdered at least 33 teenage boys and young men in the 1970s. Before his execution in 1994, he requested a final meal of fried chicken, fried shrimp, French fries, and fresh strawberries.</span><span class=credit>Murderpedia</span> <span class=caption-body>In 2011, Texas prison officials made the decision to disallow death-row inmates the privilege of a final meal request after racist killer Lawrence Russell Brewer's expansive and uneaten final food order. For his final meal he asked for: two chicken fried steaks, a triple-meat bacon cheeseburger, fried okra, a pound of barbecue, three fajitas, a meat-lover's pizza, a pint of ice cream, and a slab of peanut butter fudge with crushed peanuts. He did not eat any of it.</span><span class=credit>Reuters</span> <span class=caption-body>Infamous serial killer Ted Bundy confessed to the murder of at least 30 people shortly before his execution in 1989. He declined a special meal and was given the standard fare dished out to other death-row inmates at the Florida State Prison: medium-rare steak, eggs over easy, toast with butter and jelly, hash browns, milk, coffee, and juice.</span><span class=credit>State Archives of Florida</span> <span class=caption-body>Before the September 11 attacks, the Oklahoma City Bombing was the deadliest act of terrorism within the United States.

However, the American legal system disagreed and she was executed by lethal injection in 2002. She declined a final meal, but instead asked for a single cup of coffee.</span><span class=credit>Florida Department of Corrections/Pixabay</span> <span class=caption-body>There are few more formidable criminals than Stanley "Tookie" Williams. The American gang member and convicted murderer took up bodybuilding while imprisoned at a young age and cut an imposing figure. He was executed amidst much controversy in 2005. On the day of the execution, he refused a special meal and ate nothing but oatmeal and milk.</span><span class=credit>California Deptartment of Corrections</span> <span class=caption-body>In an act of selflessness, Tennessee inmate Philip Workman asked that a vegetarian pizza be distributed to any homeless person in Nashville. His 2007 request was denied by prison officials, but some local groups decided to fulfill his wishes and donated pizzas to homeless shelters.</span><span class=credit>Pixabay</span> <span class=caption-body>In 1979, Marion Albert Pruett went on a killing spree that claimed the lives of five victims. He was convicted and placed on death row in Arkansas. He ate only a portion of his sizable last meal: three bites from one of the two cheeseburgers he requested, six slices of an eight-slice pizza and eight slices of fried green tomatoes. He ate half of his onion rings and neglected his fries completely. He drank a quart of buttermilk and had a slice of pecan pie.</span><span class=credit>Denver Post</span> <span class=caption-body>The man convicted of murdering Charles Lindbergh's baby, Bruno Richard Hauptmann opted for a final meal of chicken, buttered peas, French fries, olives, celery, cherries, and a slice of cake before his execution in 1936.</span><span class=credit>Flemington Police Department</span> <span class=caption-body>In September 2010, Teresa Lewis became the first female convict to be killed by lethal injection in the state of Virginia.

Instead he shot the officer in the back before turning the gun on himself in an attempted suicide. He survived a gunshot wound to the head, but was left intellectually impaired. His mental insufficiency was perhaps best illustrated when he told officers on the day of his execution, in 1992, that he was saving his pecan pie for later. The rest of the meal consisted of steak, fried chicken, and cherry Kool-Aid. Correction officers refrained from disposing of the pecan pie until after his execution.</span><span class=credit>Pixabay</span><p class=social-callout>Like this gallery?<br>Share it:</p><img decoding=async alt="Lawrence Russell Brewer" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img///allthatsinteresting.com/thumb/630.501.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lawrence-russell-brewer.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> 30 Last Meals Of Infamous Criminals Before They Were Executed View Gallery<p class=dropcaps>In France, prisoners condemned to die were once granted no formal last meals. A "little glass of rum" was the only offering before shuffling off this mortal coil. Today, however, many prisons across the developed world at least entertain the idea of last meals for those about to be executed.</p><p>And the meal choices made by those on death row have long piqued the interest of those who argue that these decisions are powerful reflections of a person's character and personality. Perhaps prisoners who've committed terrible crimes motivated by dark psychological impulses beyond our understanding actually reveal something about their innermost self via their choice of final meal.</p><p>There's "The Vampire of Düsseldorf," the vicious serial killer who asked for seconds of his final meal. Then there's notorious murderer John Wayne Gacy, who went out in a blaze of decadent deep-fried glory.</p><p>On the other hand, Saddam Hussein and serial killer Aileen Wournos made only very modest requests, while murderer Ted Bundy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made no request at all</a> (but ended up getting something anyway).</p><p>Some went for broke with a gluttonous feast while some ate light before meeting their fate. Some went savory while some went sweet. Some went nutritious while some, well, did not. All in all, these last meals are as varied as the people who ordered them.</p><p>Nevertheless, perhaps each meal does reveal something intimate about the criminal who ingested it. Perhaps there, with their death at hand, they let their guard down and showed us something about who they really were.</p><p>To see more about the last meals of executed criminals, view the gallery above and see what you think: Do these requests reveal much about the criminals who made them?</p><p>After this look at last meals, check out some of the <a href=#>last words of executed criminals</a> as well.
