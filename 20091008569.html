Known as perhaps the best "manic" on-screen since Anthony Perkins, he has, almost without exception, played con men, murderers, degenerates and loud-mouthed mavericks.&nbsp;</p><p id=eiv9bnMQEhCc data-wc=37>His eyes project a menace that transfixes the audience as soon as he appears. The nervousness, the fidgeting and the obsessive visage all work to rivet attention. He may not be pretty, but James certainly is captivating.</p><p id=eo7ufKGphKrH data-wc=60>Born in Vernal, Utah, on April 18, 1947, James is the son of a US Army Intelligence officer father Gail and his teacher wife Martha. The family moved frequently because of Gail's Army career, but eventually settled in Warwick, Rhode Island. After his father's death during a routine operation, the actor helped raise his brother Michael, ten years his junior.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQVYfL_udOTx data-wc=64>Meanwhile, he was turning in straight As at high school, and earned himself a scholarship at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to major in Political Science. Having discovered in high school that he had a talent for acting, James joined MIT's Drama Workshop, and by his senior year had notched up 36 leading roles in plays in both Boston and New York.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecm7Kf8CgFU1 data-wc=84>To the surprise of his peers he dropped out of MIT in 1968, just a few months shy of graduation, and moved to New York City to pursue a career in acting. After several years treading the boards and appearing in minor films, James attracted widespread attention for his starring role as psychotic cop killer Gregory Powell in 1979's <i>The Onion Field</i>. It was a performance which contained many of the elements associated with the actor grim humour, intelligence, energy, and an unpredictable anger.&nbsp;</p><p id=elpDHSXZI-hS data-wc=46>He quickly became typecast, and similar roles followed: William Hurt's disturbed friend in <i>Eyewitness</i>; a manipulative and dangerous nightclub owner in Taylor Hackford's <i>Against All Odds</i>; and the childhood friend and fellow gangster of <a aria-label="Biography of Robert De Niro" class=hm-link href=#>Robert De Niro</a> in Sergio Leone's <i>Once Upon A Time In America</i>.</p><p id=eopfu8MMI4-7 data-wc=55>As an actor James has always been willing to risk alienating audiences, and is often able to find glimmers of moral dignity and pathos in the most loathsome characters. His part as a dangerously irresponsible journalist in Oliver Stone's 1986 <i>Salvador</i> for which he earned his sole Best Actor nomination is a case in point.</p><p id=eBwacpXQivYQ data-wc=63>His TV roles, on the other hand, have often allowed the actor to explore less hard-bitten characters. He won the first of two Emmy Awards for his role as James Garner's schizophrenic younger brother in the 1986 TV movie <i>The Promise</i> and won a second for his portrayal of Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous in 1989's <i>My Name Is Bill W</i>.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewrh0A9wiDHE data-wc=53>In the Nineties he remained true to form as Lester Diamond, the pimp to <a aria-label="Biography of Sharon Stone" class=hm-link href=#>Sharon Stone</a>'s call girl in 1995's <i>Casino</i>. The following year he won a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for his role in <i>Ghosts Of Mississippi</i> and in 2002 teamed up with <a aria-label="Biography of Denzel Washington" class=hm-link href=#>Denzel Washington</a> to make the hit thriller <i>John Q</i>.</p><p id=emHMWuYF0ZGl data-wc=55>Despite his high profile, James has yet to become the mega-star some think him capable of being. His love of risky, eccentric films, less-than-glamorous personas and reputation for obsessive behaviour have hampered his career. The actor, however, seems to relish his image. "If I'm obsessed, thank God," he says. "I hope I stay that way."</p><p id=epD5l_XfErqb data-wc=55>In his personal life, despite having been married twice once in 1983 and again in 1989 at heart James seems to be a consummate bachelor. His relationship with <i>Blade Runner</i> actress Sean Young broke down in the late Eighties and he has since been romantically linked with actresses Heather Graham, Nicollette Sheridan and Ashley Madison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9ubmlkt6K5xKxksKefmcBw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20091008569.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f20091008569.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f20091008569.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f20091008569.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20091008569.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20091008569.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-hidive-class-action-lawsuit-explained.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-hidive-class-action-lawsuit-explained.html>The HIDIVE class action lawsuit explained</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./archive-81-explained-kaelego-otherworld-baldung-witches-and-more.html>Archive 81 Explained: Kaelego, Otherworld, Baldung Witches, and More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./archive-81-explained-kaelego-otherworld-baldung-witches-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
