A big part of their success has come from captain and star defensive lineman Arik Armstead, so much so that many want to learn more about Arik's life beyond the gridiron.</p><p>Many wanted to learn more about Arik's wife, including who she is and whether they have any kids together. Thankfully, we've got everything you need to know about Arik's wife, Mindy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Arik Armstead's wife?</h2><p>Arik is married Mindy Armstead, a psychiatrist who is also the mother to the two children they share. In a recent interview with Today, Mindy said that she tries to keep their lives in order in spite of Arik's hectic and demanding schedule.</p><p>“No one else can understand that pressure to be kind of this emotional powerhouse and support system for your significant other,” she said during the interview.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She added that the wives of NFL players bond really quickly as a result of the unusual lives that they all lead.</p><p>“I think we really band together, and you end up making super-fast friends because of that," she explained. "We’re all part of this team. We’re anxious and worried, and we’re thinking about, ‘Are things taken care of at home so that they can focus on the game?’”</p><p>Mindy also added that Arik relies on her to keep their day-to-day lives humming.</p><p>“I’ve got to take the car for the oil change and I've got to do all the daycare tours and do the fun things, but also the not so fun things,” she explained.</p><p>Although all eyes are on the players on game day, Mindy has managed to become a fairly prominent online personality in her own right, and has an Instagram following of more than 500,000, which is roughly double what her husband's is.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram/@arikarmstead</span></figure><p>Mindy posts photos of her own life, which obviously overlaps with her husband's, but also includes plenty of photos of the two young kids they share. Mindy may support her husband on gameday, but her Instagram makes it clear that she also takes plenty of time to live her own life.</p><p>Of course, Arik's busy season is the fall and winter, when the NFL is in season, but he also gets a fairly lengthy break each year when he can be a more regular husband and father. Professional sports careers are typically pretty short, which means it makes sense that Arik is prioritizing his life on the field while he can still get paid for doing it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2Bqt4yaqaarpJqupXnWop2e</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2farik-armstead-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2farik-armstead-wife.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2farik-armstead-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2farik-armstead-wife.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2farik-armstead-wife.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2farik-armstead-wife.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-the-donovan-song-jennifer-juniper-really-about.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-the-donovan-song-jennifer-juniper-really-about.html>Who Is The Donovan Song Jennifer Juniper Really About?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mousa-dembele-age-wikipedia-biography-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html>Mousa Dembele Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mousa-dembele-age-wikipedia-biography-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
