According to the police report recalled by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, Tom and Mariah claim that Daisy started stalking the two of them in January 2024, in their Los Vegas neighborhood. The report states that Daisy allegedly chased Tom around their neighborhood, invaded his personal space, and sniffed him.</p><p>The allegations against Daisy continued to escalate, with Tom claiming that Daisy chased him and Mariah around their apartment building when they went to go get into their car. He claims Daisy jumped into the backseat of their car and didn't leave until police were called. After the police showed up, there weren't any arrests made.</p><p>However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> also reports that Daisy insisted these reports aren't accurate. Although she admitted to being in a mental health episode during the time these claims were made against her, she explained that when she claimed her love for Tom, she was actually talking about Tom Cruise.</p><p>Daisy acknowledged that she did enter Tom and Mariah's car, a moment that unfolded during her episode ‚Äî a situation she went on to address with professional support at a treatment facility. While Daisy expressed remorse for her actions, she also shared that she was pained by the fact her mental health challenges were captured on camera.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxllJa2tMWMn6mopV2nvKS3jKidZqSfq7Juus6w</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-is-daisy-from-rock-of-love-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhere-is-daisy-from-rock-of-love-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhere-is-daisy-from-rock-of-love-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhere-is-daisy-from-rock-of-love-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-is-daisy-from-rock-of-love-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-is-daisy-from-rock-of-love-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./darrell-freeman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-340781-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./darrell-freeman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-340781-html.html>Darrell Freeman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./thuso-mbedu.html>Thuso Mbedu</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./thuso-mbedu.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
