The two have been open about <a href=#>their love and affection towards one another </a>on social media and truly seemed to be living the dream. They often shared loving messages to one another and appeared to be having a good time when they were spotted out and about in one another's company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People reports that unlike <a href=#>other celebrity breakups</a>, this one really stunned fans as<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> there was really no prelude and no visible signs of trouble</a> in the form of scandals or controversial moments in front of the cameras. Now that their divorce proceedings have officially been announced, fans are eager to figure out anything and everything that will reveal the reason this couple decided to call it quits on their three-year marriage.</p><h2 id=we-may-never-really-know><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>We May Never Really Know</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Kaley and Karl took to social media to write a statement about one another, declaring their love and support for one another, and asking for privacy during this sensitive time. They have been pretty low key on the details and have stated; "We have both shared so much of our journey publicly so while we would prefer to keep this aspect of our personal life private, we wanted to be forthcoming in our truth together. There is no anger or animosity, quite the contrary.‚Äù It looks like the truth behind the reason for their divorce is a detail fans may never really know.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Blame Pete Davidson For Kaley Cuoco's Split With Her Husband</a></span></p><h2 id=there-were-hints-of-trouble-in-kaley-cuoco-and-karl-cook-39-s-life><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>There Were Hints Of Trouble In Kaley Cuoco And Karl Cook's Life</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It may not have appeared like a hint or clue at the time, but now that fans are able to look back at prior posts from the couple on social media, it appears that there were some hints of trouble along the way. Small comments were made in their anniversary posts, in which they slyly wrote that they were surprised to have been able to put up with one another. Fans didn't spot the cryptic messaging before, but they definitely see it now...</p><h2 id=whatever-happened-between-them-wasn-39-t-too-messy><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Whatever Happened Between Them Wasn't Too Messy</span></h2><p>It's never easy to decide to divorce a spouse, so it's assumed that something major happend that Kaley and Karl simply couldn't repair or perhaps decided not to fix. Whatever it was that happened, fans assume it wasn't really a very messy incident, as they appear to be very respectful towards one another and still declare their love and respect to one another, even while announcing their split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-appears-they-tried-to-work-things-out><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>It Appears They Tried To Work Things Out</span></h2><p>Kaley's anniversary post to Karl was written 9 weeks ago, and she made the comment; "I love you so much and I can't wait for a million more years." Just two months later, the two have announced and already filed for their divorce, so fans presume they have had troubles and tried to work them out along the way. Their anniversary post led fans to believe they were blissfully happy and excited about the future together, but it must have been made at a high point in their repair process, but whatever they tried to do to stay together just simply didn't work.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Reacts To Kaley Cuoco's Obsession With Brad Pitt</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kaley-and-karl-39-s-split-hasn-39-t-made-them-vile-towards-one-another><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kaley And Karl's Split Hasn't Made Them Vile Towards One Another</span></h2><p>Many celebrity divorces result in a lot of trash-talk and public dragging. Whatever the reason for their split, it hasn't made Kaley and Karl vile towards one another, so fans assume neither has been hurt or damaged by the other's actions. They've been respectful and still admit to loving one another, making this celebrity divorce strangely drama-free.</p><h2 id=their-divorce-has-nothing-to-do-with-money><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Their Divorce Has Nothing To Do With Money</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing we know for sure about their reason for divorcing is that it has absolutely nothing to do with money. Both Karl and Kaley have a whole lot of money under their belts, but as US Magazine reports,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> they've both protected their independent wealth with an iron clad prenup</a>. Neither party is challenging the prenup that is in place, and it's apparent that money is definitely not the issue for this couple. Whatever has gone wrong during their three-year marriage has nothing to do with finances, so that rules out that aspect of things...</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Are Obsessed With Kaley Cuoco and Pete Davidson Goofing Around On The Set Of 'Meet Cute'</a></span></p><h2 id=this-has-definitely-been-a-long-time-coming><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>This Has Definitely Been A Long Time Coming</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, in spite of things looking bright from the outside looking in, it appears that their divorce is something that both Kaley and Karl began talking about a long time ago. Global News reports that they announced their split on the very same day that they filed for divorce, meaning they were well aware of the situation at hand, had already spoken about it, and planned the details together - all without leaking any information to fans along the way. Fans now realize that if they had already gone through so much of this process quietly, behind closed doors, there must have been trouble in paradise for a long time prior to the media being informed of their split.</p><h2 id=they-39-re-simply-heading-in-different-directions><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They're Simply Heading In Different Directions</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kaley Cuoco's statement read; ‚ÄúDespite a deep love and respect for one another, we have realized that our current paths have taken us in opposite directions." Fans may think there's more to the story that isn't being revealed, but the truth may very well have already been handed to them. This couple, like many others, may have realized that they just aren't a match that will stand the test of time, and that they want different things from life. Their future may not be one that works well together, and it seems that Kaley and Karl were able to break off their marriage in a healthy way, giving one another the best possible start towards a brighter future.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>All The Men Kaley Cuoco Has Dated, In Chronological Order</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsBut8ClnLJlk6q8pLuMrKeloaSptq%2BzjK6nZq%2BZqbVutMSrZKGto5eur7CMpJirpF2YvLC3jKGcq52jYsSprdNmrp5lm6O8uHmO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-is-kaley-cuoco-splitting-up-with-her-husband-karl-cook-heres-what-we-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-is-kaley-cuoco-splitting-up-with-her-husband-karl-cook-heres-what-we-know.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-is-kaley-cuoco-splitting-up-with-her-husband-karl-cook-heres-what-we-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-is-kaley-cuoco-splitting-up-with-her-husband-karl-cook-heres-what-we-know.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-is-kaley-cuoco-splitting-up-with-her-husband-karl-cook-heres-what-we-know.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-kaley-cuoco-splitting-up-with-her-husband-karl-cook-heres-what-we-know.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./yan-vostrikov.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./yan-vostrikov.html>Yan Vostrikov</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-untold-truth-of-machine-gun-kelly.html>The Untold Truth Of Machine Gun Kelly</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-untold-truth-of-machine-gun-kelly.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
