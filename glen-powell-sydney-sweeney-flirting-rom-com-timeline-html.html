The unbridled flirtatious energy between these two rising movie stars wouldn’t be quite such a big deal were it not for the fact that Sweeney is currently engaged to her boyfriend of four years, restaurateur Jonathan Davino, while Powell was thought to be with his girlfriend of three, model Gigi Paris —&nbsp;though that was recently proven not to be the case.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0pada7000h3b6vmkl19fpf@published data-word-count=156>All appearances would suggest that Sweeney and Powell have hooked up, but the pair’s PR teams and a myriad of anonymous sources have been working overtime all week to prove to the tabloids that this film is not going to be another <a href=#>Mr. & Mrs. Smith situation</a>. These two are just really, really good method actors, okay?! Whether or not life is actually imitating art and these two have fallen head over heels while pretending to fall head over heels still remains to be seen. But if this is all just a strategy to get us excited to see a rom-com that didn’t even have a title until this week, it’s working. The movie has instantly become one of the most anticipated rom-coms of the year. (And we needed a rom-com with good chemistry. I mean, remember Ashton Kutcher and Reese Witherspoon <a href=#>during their rom-com promotional circuit for Your Place or Mine</a> back in February? Exactly.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0padbw000i3b6vq2679wtt@published data-word-count=65>So while we may never know what went down on that movie set, what we can say is that Sweeney and Powell have certainly provided plenty of fodder to keep those will-they, won’t-they rumors circulating in perpetuity and get butts into movie seats whenever this thing does finally come out. Here, all the times these romantic leads played their roles just a little too well.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0padir000j3b6vmiffiwop@published data-word-count=3><strong>The Offscreen Chemistry</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0pdllx00163b6vnps7ww23@published data-word-count=107>Since the cast was announced at the beginning of the year, Powell and Sweeney have been in Australia filming Anyone But You, from the director of Easy A and Friends With Benefits, matchmaker Will Gluck. From the moment paparazzi images of the two of them on set started surfacing, fans couldn’t help but take note of the pair’s natural chemistry both <a href=#>during scenes</a> and <a href=#>in between takes</a> —&nbsp;not to mention the way they always seemed to be positioned <a href=#>next to each other in group photos</a> and that Sweeney spent <a href=#>a whole lot of quality time</a> with Powell’s family during filming, for someone who is simply a colleague.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0pdmyu001e3b6v2rj2cggy@published data-word-count=147>Filming wrapped shortly after Paris’s departure, and Powell and Sweeney began to post all sorts of behind-the-scenes content from their time working together to drum up excitement for the movie’s release. However, that content drummed up a little more excitement than either of them intended. One video in particular, in which Sweeney does a trust fall off a couch <a href=#>into Powell’s arms</a>, set social media alight with condolences to the two actors’ partners. <a href=#>Another Instagram slideshow</a> posted by Sweeney, in which she and Powell’s heads are touching in almost every single shot, certainly didn’t help the speculation. Although, as someone with a lot of friends who graduated from the NYU Drama department, I have to point out that this is also classic actor behavior. If you’re an actor and you aren’t somehow in physical contact with another actor, did you ever really zip, zap, zop at all?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/3c3/12b/ae561e57c1f3db565047b908c0e87726ab-sweeney-powell-swim.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0pado4000m3b6viuc3zsac@published data-word-count=3><strong>The Real-Life Breakup</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0pcxdx000z3b6vjchs2emj@published data-word-count=75>Last month, suspicions began that Powell’s relationship with Paris was on the rocks after the model went to visit him on set but stayed for less than two weeks — an amount of time that I thought seemed perfectly reasonable to go visit a person, let alone a person at work in Australia, but that “<a href=#>Page Six</a>” implied really is not. And considering the trajectory of this whole narrative, I guess the publication was right!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0pe5v1001l3b6vuv67nuwd@published data-word-count=105>Shortly after Sweeney shared the above carousel of treasured memories from Down Under, Paris unfollowed her. The model then all but spelled out what happened in a string of not-so-cryptic <a href=#>Instagram Stories</a>, posting music such as Fleetwood Mac’s “Silver Springs” and the Wild Rivers’ “Thinking ’Bout Love” (from their album Songs to Break Up To), both of which are about the demise of a relationship. She also shared an image from Gabby Bernstein that read, “gut feelings are guardian angels,” then capped off her posting spree with<a href=#> a telltale sexy photo shoot</a> captioned “never better” with a waving emoji. Paris later unfollowed Powell as well.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0peqr0001r3b6vkqe2ukdo@published data-word-count=4><strong>The Press Tour Begins</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0pf59s001y3b6vgdwyrhx0@published data-word-count=77>This week, on April 25, the two romantic-comedy leads arrived in Las Vegas to promote the film at CinemaCon, and fans noticed that Sydney wasn’t wearing her engagement ring during the appearance. Again, not the most unusual behavior for an actress who has outfit changes and jewelry-brand contracts to fulfill. But given the current headlines, you’d think she’d like to dissuade out of respect to her fiancé; the choice to go ringless did seem a little sus.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0pf6pl00253b6vxp2vvv0l@published data-word-count=46>During this appearance, Sweeney and Powell also had a string of very playful exchanges (that is, when they weren’t gazing at each other with doe eyes and goofy grins). Clearly, they had a whole lot of practice pretending to be in love while filming in Australia.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0pf6pm00263b6v8ratyzvf@published data-word-count=58>At the height of all the gossip swirling around this week, Sweeney chose this particular moment to <a href=#>post a video</a> of herself wearing a crop top that reads “KISS THE BOYS AND MAKE THEM CRY” —&nbsp;which, as with all of the above evidence of this supposed affair, is either a completely innocuous detail or the obvious smoking gun.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0pfpcc002k3b6v0dam1fmk@published data-word-count=115>On April 26, Paris finally confirmed that she and Powell had broken up, <a href=#>posting a video</a> of herself walking away with the caption “Know your worth & onto the next.” However, according to a source who spoke to <a href=#>People</a>, the couple actually split up weeks before all this drama unfolded, following earlier breakups and reconciliations. “Gigi and Glen had broken up several times,” the source said. “They had been on the rocks since Top Gun came out. Gigi was never happy with the long distance filming and when she came to Australia they both decided to break up for good.” So what I’m hearing is Powell has actually been single for weeks now … interesting.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0pf6pv00273b6vzufs42eb@published data-word-count=84>Sweeney, however, is still very much engaged to her fiancé, “multiple sources with knowledge” confirmed to <a href=#>TMZ</a>. They also confirmed that the couple is still living together and that she and Powell are “not dating,” though we didn’t exactly ask if they’re dating. Davino was seen outside the home he and Sweeney share in Los Angeles on Tuesday carrying a couple of duffel bags and her dog’s bed, suggesting Sweeney and Powell really might just be incredible actors taking the verisimilitude way too far.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh0pjc4o002r3b6vccl1at2x@published data-word-count=42>Either way, I blame Tom Cruise for all of this. When he and Powell were filming Top Gun: Maverick together, <a href=#>Cruise told him</a> to “lean into” being a douchebag, thus setting off a chain of pop-culture events he couldn’t have possibly foretold.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clgwdvwnn00000ijk6jywdrkn@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney Flirt in Front of CinemaCon</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjmuuaaza007h1jy6t7j3ify6@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Every Compliment Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga Exchange During Star Is Born Press</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckx6q3u91000014ojj82ul01s@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Tom Holland and Zendaya Turned the Spider-Man Press Tour Into a Rom-Com</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Glen and Sydney Are Promoting That Rom-com a Little Too Well</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgaXyouMSnZKmnp5q5rXnSspunnaliwLixxKecsmWWobazwMinnmaqn6J6pLvMZquipZWhtq%2BxjaGrpqQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fglen-powell-sydney-sweeney-flirting-rom-com-timeline-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fglen-powell-sydney-sweeney-flirting-rom-com-timeline-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fglen-powell-sydney-sweeney-flirting-rom-com-timeline-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fglen-powell-sydney-sweeney-flirting-rom-com-timeline-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fglen-powell-sydney-sweeney-flirting-rom-com-timeline-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fglen-powell-sydney-sweeney-flirting-rom-com-timeline-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kari-mcdonough-denis-mcdonough-wife-and-family-age-net-worth-wiki-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kari-mcdonough-denis-mcdonough-wife-and-family-age-net-worth-wiki-biography.html>Kari McDonough: Denis McDonough Wife And Family, Age, Net Worth, Wiki, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./charrisse-jackson-jordan.html>Charrisse Jackson-Jordan</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./charrisse-jackson-jordan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
