This article will explore the percentage of girls who play softball in high school and go on to play at the Division I level, as well as the factors that can affect their chances of making it to this level.</p><p>According to recent data, only about 8% of high school softball players will compete at the college level, and approximately 1% will play Division I ball. This means that out of the 357,110 high school girls who play softball, only about 28,569 will play in college, and only about 3,571 of those will play at the Division I level. These numbers are low, but it's important to remember that playing at the college level, regardless of division, is a significant accomplishment that requires a lot of hard work and dedication.</p><p>One of the most important factors that can affect a high school softball player's chances of playing at the college level is their performance on the field. Coaches at the college level are looking for players who are skilled and talented, and who can help their team win games. They are also looking for players who are coachable, have a good attitude, and are willing to work hard to improve their skills. High school players who want to play at the college level should focus on improving their skills and performance on the field, as this will increase their chances of being <a href=#>recruited</a> by college coaches.</p><p>Another factor that can affect a high school softball player's chances of playing at the college level is their academic performance. Good grades can double a high school athlete's chances of playing at the college level. This is because college coaches are looking for players who are not only talented on the field but also academically capable of succeeding in college. High school players who want to play at the college level should focus on maintaining good grades and taking challenging courses, as this will make them more attractive to college <a href=#>coaches</a>.</p><p>In addition to performance on the field and academic performance, there are other factors that can affect a high school softball player's chances of playing at the college level. One of these is the number of international athletes playing a certain sport. Tennis has the steepest odds due to over 60% of roster spots being filled by international athletes. This means that high school softball players may face stiffer competition for roster spots at colleges with large numbers of international players. However, this is not a factor that is within the control of the high school player, so it's important to focus on what they can control, such as their performance on the field and their academic performance.</p><p>High school softball players who want to play at the college level should also be aware of the <a href=#>recruiting</a> process. Softball players can be offered scholarships from over 1,600 colleges in the United States. These scholarships are awarded through the college's softball program, which athletes must apply to by going through the softball recruiting process. Softball is classified as an equivalency sport for scholarship purposes, which means that not all scholarships are full-ride, and coaches can distribute scholarships as they see fit. Making it to college level requires a lot of hard work, and only about 8.4% of high school softball players make it to college. It is nearly impossible to calculate an average softball scholarship as amounts vary by college tuition and coaching philosophy.</p><p>In conclusion, the percentage of girls who play softball in high school and go on to play at the Division I level is very low, with only about 1% of high school softball players making it to this level. However, playing at the college level, regardless of division, is a significant accomplishment that requires a lot of hard work and dedication. High school softball players who want to play at the college level should focus on improving their skills and performance on the field, maintaining good grades, and being aware of the <a href=#>recruiting</a> process. By doing so, they can increase their chances of making it to the college level and achieving their dreams of playing softball at a higher level.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn5qsXaWys6%2FEp6uan5VivKd5xqKppatdrLWwec%2BlmLJlo6Szta7ApaNmn59isXI%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-percentage-of-girls-who-play-softball-go-d1.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-percentage-of-girls-who-play-softball-go-d1.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-percentage-of-girls-who-play-softball-go-d1.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-percentage-of-girls-who-play-softball-go-d1.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-percentage-of-girls-who-play-softball-go-d1.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-percentage-of-girls-who-play-softball-go-d1.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kirsten-dunst-wedding-ring-outing-jesse-plemons-marriage-pics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kirsten-dunst-wedding-ring-outing-jesse-plemons-marriage-pics.html>Kirsten Dunst Debuts Wedding Ring As Shes Seen For The 1st Time Since Marrying Jesse Plemons</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-the-monthly-payment-on-a-50k-heloc.html>What is the monthly payment on a 50k HELOC?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-is-the-monthly-payment-on-a-50k-heloc.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
