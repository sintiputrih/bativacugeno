One in particular was mentioned by Courteney Cox, as she revealed her pick as the worst person at memorizing their lines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-did-courteney-cox-call-the-worst-at-memorizing-their-lines>Who Did Courteney Cox Call The Worst At Memorizing Their Lines?</h2><p>During the reunion, Courteney Cox revealed that there was a lot about the show that she had completely forgotten about. According to Cox, she stated alongside Today that perhaps <a href=#>it was better to have brushed up on her knowledge relating to the show.</a></p><p>“I should’ve watched all ten seasons because when I did the reunion and was asked questions, I was like, ‘I don’t remember being there,’” she laughed. “Yeah. I don’t remember filming so many episodes."</p><p>"I see it on TV sometimes and I stop and go, 'Oh my God, I don’t remember this at all,'" she added. "But it’s so funny."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Was Holding In Her Laugh During This Unscripted 'Friends' Moment</a></span></p><p>Although her memory relating to the show is sketchy, she does remember the exact moment she knew the show was going to be a huge hit. It all happened in 1994 when the show's director told the cast it was the last time they'd be able to walk into a casino together.</p><p>“He gave us all $500. And he said, ‘I want you to take care, like, really take notice of this moment because it will be the last time that all six of you together can walk through a casino,'" she said. "And we were like, “Really?” And it was true. We never could never do that (again).”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cox-said-jennifer-aniston-flubbed-her-lines-the-most>Cox Said Jennifer Aniston Flubbed Her Lines The Most</h2><p>In a special 'Friends' behind the scenes feature, which was shot years ago while the show was going on, the cast opened up, discussing what goes on behind the scenes. They shared some hilarious stories, like Matt LeBlanc stating that he would troll Ross. How? Well, when it was time to shoot, Schwimmer would put his video game on pause, but what he didn't know is that LeBlanc would enter his dressing room, start the video game and purposely get David's character killed...</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>'Friends' Fans Caught Someone Else As Monica During This Scene</a></span></p><p>Another question asked was who had the hardest time remembering their lines. According to Cox, the answer was an easy one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Who flubs the lines the most? Jennifer, I don't think she's gotten one right since we started the show. It is like take after take," Cox stated. (At the 3:30 mark in the video below.)</p><p>Hilariously, Matthew Perry aka Chandler would agree with Cox's comments, saying "she's correct, I've never heard her say a smarter thing in her life."</p><p>The cast might've been on to something, as Aniston does in fact have a history of going off script.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-was-known-for-going-off-script>Jennifer Aniston Was Known For Going Off-Script</h2><p>Yes, even a legendary show like 'Friends' wasn't exactly as polished as most would assume. In fact, the show featured several unscripted moments. Remember when Chandler was stuck in Rachel's boss' office, and he would smash the filing cabinet on his head, yup, that was all completely unscripted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aniston had a tendency to do so as well, and one of the moments happened to be among the more memorable. In 'The One After Vegas," <a href=#>Aniston completely made up the "this is the world's worst hangover" line</a>. The moment got such a huge laugh from the audience that they actually had to edit the crowd noise once it was placed into the episode.</p><p>That wasn't the only organic moment Aniston faced on the show. During the episode that she's teaching Ben how to do pranks, David Schwimmer has a little fun of his own, throwing a fake Dummy down the stairs of the apartment building. Some might thing Jen's reaction was over the top and this is mainly because <a href=#>she didn't know the moment was going to take place.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hilariously, it was David Schwimmer that also helped to produce the episode.</p><p>Clearly, these friends had a blast behind the scenes, and it was evident given their chemistry on-screen.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>According To The 'Friends' Credits, Russ Wasn't Played By David Schwimmer</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaqK2iqbKvsdhmmqiwXaiuqrCMo5ynppmbsrN5wKegrKyfo3q4rdJmq6GdXay8s7%2FTZpitZZ2aurC%2ByLOgp59dnbKzecuipZ6rXaS7brLRopynnKNk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcourteney-cox-said-jennifer-aniston-was-the-worst-at-memorizing-her-lines-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcourteney-cox-said-jennifer-aniston-was-the-worst-at-memorizing-her-lines-on-friends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcourteney-cox-said-jennifer-aniston-was-the-worst-at-memorizing-her-lines-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcourteney-cox-said-jennifer-aniston-was-the-worst-at-memorizing-her-lines-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcourteney-cox-said-jennifer-aniston-was-the-worst-at-memorizing-her-lines-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcourteney-cox-said-jennifer-aniston-was-the-worst-at-memorizing-her-lines-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jozy-altidore-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jozy-altidore-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html>Jozy Altidore Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./camille-kostek-2.html>Camille Kostek Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./camille-kostek-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
